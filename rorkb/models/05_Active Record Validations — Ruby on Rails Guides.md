# Active Record Validations

###### This guide teaches you how to validate Active Record objects before saving them to the database using Active

###### Record's validations feature.

###### After reading this guide, you will know:

###### How to use the built-in Active Record validations and options.

###### How to check the validity of objects.

###### How to create conditional and strict validations.

###### How to create your own custom validation methods.

###### How to work with the validation error messages and displaying them in views.

## 1. Validations Overview

###### Here's an example of a very simple validation:

###### As you can see, the Person is not valid without a name attribute.

###### Before we dig into more details, let's talk about how validations fit into the big picture of your application.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, presence: true
end
```
```
irb> Person.new(name: "John Doe").valid?
=> true
irb> Person.new(name: nil).valid?
=> false
```

### 1.1. Why Use Validations?

###### Validations are used to ensure that only valid data is saved into your database. For example, it may be important

###### to your application to ensure that every user provides a valid email address and mailing address. Model-level

###### validations are the best way to ensure that only valid data is saved into your database. They can be used with any

###### database, cannot be bypassed by end users, and are convenient to test and maintain. Rails provides built-in

###### helpers for common needs, and allows you to create your own validation methods as well.

### 1.2. Alternate Ways to Validate

###### There are several other ways to validate data before it is saved into your database, including native database

###### constraints, client-side validations and controller-level validations. Here's a summary of the pros and cons:

###### Database constraints and/or stored procedures make the validation mechanisms database-dependent and

###### can make testing and maintenance more difficult. However, if your database is used by other applications,

###### it may be a good idea to use some constraints at the database level. Additionally, database-level

###### validations can safely handle some things (such as uniqueness in heavily-used tables) that can be difficult

###### to implement otherwise.

###### Client-side validations can be useful, but are generally unreliable if used alone. If they are implemented

###### using JavaScript, they may be bypassed if JavaScript is turned off in the user's browser. However, if

###### combined with other techniques, client-side validation can be a convenient way to provide users with

###### immediate feedback as they use your site.

###### Controller-level validations can be tempting to use, but often become unwieldy and difficult to test and

###### maintain. Whenever possible, it's a good idea to keep your controllers simple, as it will make working with

###### your application easier in the long run.

###### Rails recommends using model-level validations in most circumstances, however there may be specific cases

###### where you want to complement them with alternate validations.

### 1.3. Validation Triggers

###### There are two kinds of Active Record objects - those that correspond to a row inside your database and those

###### that do not. When you instantiate a new object, using the new method, the object does not get saved in the

###### database as yet. Once you call save on that object, it will be saved into the appropriate database table. Active

###### Record uses an instance method called persisted? (and its inverse new_record?) to determine whether an

###### object is already in the database or not. Consider the following Active Record class:

###### We can see how it works by looking at some bin/rails console output:

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
end
```

###### Saving a new record will send an SQL INSERT operation to the database, whereas updating an existing record

###### will send an SQL UPDATE operation. Validations are typically run before these commands are sent to the

###### database. If any validations fail, the object will be marked as invalid and Active Record will not perform the

###### INSERT or UPDATE operation. This helps to avoid storing an invalid object in the database. You can choose to

###### have specific validations run when an object is created, saved, or updated.

###### The following methods trigger validations, and will save the object to the database only if the object is valid:

```
create
```
###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence/ClassMethods.html#method-i-

###### create)

```
create!
```

###### create-21

###### save (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-save)

###### save! (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-save-21

###### update (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-update)

###### update! (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-update-

###### 21

```
irb> p = Person.new(name: "Jane Doe")
=> #<Person id: nil, name: "Jane Doe", created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
```
```
irb> p.new_record?
=> true
```
```
irb> p.persisted?
=> false
```
```
irb> p.save
=> true
```
```
irb> p.new_record?
=> false
```
```
irb> p.persisted?
=> true
```
###### While validations usually prevent invalid data from being saved to the database, it's important to be

###### aware that not all methods in Rails trigger validations. Some methods allow changes to be made

###### directly to the database without performing validations. As a result, if you're not careful, itʼs possible

###### to bypass validations and save an object in an invalid state.

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 3 / 42


##### Page 4 of 42

###### The bang versions (methods that end with an exclamation mark, like save!) raise an exception if the record is

###### invalid. The non-bang versions - save and update returns false, and create returns the object.

### 1.4. Skipping Validations

###### The following methods skip validations, and will save the object to the database regardless of its validity. They

###### should be used with caution. Refer to the method documentation to learn more.

### 1.5. Checking Validity

###### Before saving an Active Record object, Rails runs your validations, and if these validations produce any validation

###### errors, then Rails will not save the object.

###### You can also run the validations on your own. valid?

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Validations.html#method-i-valid-3F triggers your

###### validations and returns true if no errors are found in the object, and false otherwise. As you saw above:

###### After Active Record has performed validations, any failures can be accessed through the errors

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations.html#method-i-errors) instance method,

###### which returns a collection of errors. By definition, an object is valid if the collection is empty after running

###### validations.

###### save also has the ability to skip validations if validate: false is passed as an argument. This

###### technique should be used with caution.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, presence: true
end
```
```
irb> Person.new(name: "John Doe").valid?
=> true
irb> Person.new(name: nil).valid?
=> false
```
###### An object instantiated with new will not report errors even if it's technically invalid, because

###### validations are automatically run only when the object is saved, such as with the create or save

###### methods.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, presence: true
end
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 5 / 42


##### Page 6 of 42

###### invalid? (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations.html#method-i-invalid-3F is

###### the inverse of valid?. It triggers your validations, returning true if any errors were found in the object, and false

###### otherwise.

### 1.6. Inspecting and Handling Errors

###### To verify whether or not a particular attribute of an object is valid, you can use errors[:attribute]

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Errors.html#method-i-5B5D. It returns an array of

###### all the error messages for :attribute. If there are no errors on the specified attribute, an empty array is

###### returned. This allows you to easily determine whether there are any validation issues with a specific attribute.

###### Hereʼs an example illustrating how to check for errors on an attribute:

```
irb> person = Person.new
=> #<Person id: nil, name: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
irb> person.errors.size
=> 0
```
```
irb> person.valid?
=> false
irb> person.errors.objects.first.full_message
=> "Name can't be blank"
```
```
irb> person.save
=> false
```
```
irb> person.save!
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Name can't be blank
```
```
irb> Person.create!
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Name can't be blank
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, presence: true
end
```

###### Additionally, you can use the errors.add

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Errors.html#method-i-add) method to manually add

###### error messages for specific attributes. This is particularly useful when defining custom validation scenarios.

## 2. Validations

###### Active Record offers many predefined validations that you can use directly inside your class definitions. These

###### predefined validations provide common validation rules. Each time a validation fails, an error message is added to

###### the object's errors collection, and this error is associated with the specific attribute being validated.

###### When a validation fails, the error message is stored in the errors collection under the attribute name that

###### triggered the validation. This means you can easily access the errors related to any specific attribute. For

###### instance, if you validate the :name attribute and the validation fails, you will find the error message under

###### errors[:name].

###### In modern Rails applications, the more concise validate syntax is commonly used, for example:

```
irb> new_person = Person.new
irb> new_person.errors[:name]
=> [] # no errors since validations are not run until saved
irb> new_person.errors[:name].any?
=> false
```
```
irb> create_person = Person.create
irb> create_person.errors[:name]
=> ["can't be blank"] # validation error because `name` is required
irb> create_person.errors[:name].any?
=> true
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validate do |person|
errors.add :name, :too_short, message: "is not long enough"
end
end
```
###### To read about validation errors in greater depth refer to the Working with Validation Errors section.

```
validates :name, presence: true
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 7 / 42


##### Page 8 of 42

###### However, older versions of Rails used "helper" methods, such as:

###### Both notations perform the same function, but the newer form is recommended for its readability and alignment

###### with Rails' conventions.

###### Each validation accepts an arbitrary number of attribute names, allowing you to apply the same type of validation

###### to multiple attributes in a single line of code.

###### Additionally, all validations accept the :on and :message options. The :on option specifies when the validation

###### should be triggered, with possible values being :create or :update. The :message option allows you to define

###### a custom error message that will be added to the errors collection if the validation fails. If you do not specify a

###### message, Rails will use a default error message for that validation.

###### Below we outline the most commonly used validations.

### 2.1. absence

###### This validator validates that the specified attributes are absent. It uses the Object#present?

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/Object.html#method-i-present-3F method to check if the value is

###### neither nil nor a blank string - that is, a string that is either empty or consists of whitespace only.

###### #absence is commonly used for conditional validations. For example:

###### If you want to be sure that an association is absent, you'll need to test whether the associated object itself is

###### absent, and not the foreign key used to map the association.

```
validates_presence_of :name
```
###### To see a list of the available default helpers, take a look at

```
ActiveModel::Validations::HelperMethods
```
###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations/HelperMethods.html). This

###### API section uses the older notation as described above.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :phone_number, :address, absence: true, if: :invited?
end
```
```
irb> person = Person.new(name: "Jane Doe", invitation_sent_at: Time.current)
irb> person.valid?
=> true # absence validation passes
```

###### Rails will usually infer the inverse association automatically. In cases where you use a custom :foreign_key or a

###### :through association, it's important to explicitly set the :inverse_of option to optimize the association lookup.

###### This helps avoid unnecessary database queries during validation.

###### For more details, check out the Bi-directional Associations documentation (association_basics.html#bi-

###### directional-associations).

###### If you validate the absence of an object associated via a has_one (association_basics.html#the-has-one-

###### association) or has_many (association_basics.html#the-has-many-association) relationship, it will check that

###### the object is neither present? nor marked_for_destruction?.

###### Since false.present? is false, if you want to validate the absence of a boolean field you should use:

###### The default error message is "must be blank".

```
class LineItem < ApplicationRecord
belongs_to :order, optional: true
validates :order, absence: true
end
```
```
irb> line_item = LineItem.new
irb> line_item.valid?
=> true # absence validation passes
```
```
order = Order.create
irb> line_item_with_order = LineItem.new(order: order)
irb> line_item_with_order.valid?
=> false # absence validation fails
```
###### For belongs_to the association presence is validated by default. If you donʼt want to have

###### association presence validated, use optional: true.

###### If you want to ensure that the association is both present and valid, you also need to use

###### validates_associated. More on that in the validates_associated section.

```
validates :field_name, exclusion: { in: [true, false] }
```

### 2.2. acceptance

###### This method validates that a checkbox on the user interface was checked when a form was submitted. This is

###### typically used when the user needs to agree to your application's terms of service, confirm that some text is

###### read, or any similar concept.

###### This check is performed only if terms_of_service is not nil. The default error message for this validation is

###### "must be accepted". You can also pass in a custom message via the message option.

###### It can also receive an :accept option, which determines the allowed values that will be considered as

###### acceptable. It defaults to ['1', true] and can be easily changed.

###### This validation is very specific to web applications and this 'acceptance' does not need to be recorded anywhere

###### in your database. If you don't have a field for it, the validator will create a virtual attribute. If the field does exist in

###### your database, the accept option must be set to or include true or else the validation will not run.

### 2.3. confirmation

###### You should use this validator when you have two text fields that should receive exactly the same content. For

###### example, you may want to confirm an email address or a password. This validation creates a virtual attribute

###### whose name is the name of the field that has to be confirmed with "_confirmation" appended.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :terms_of_service, acceptance: true
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :terms_of_service, acceptance: { message: "must be agreed to" }
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :terms_of_service, acceptance: { accept: "yes" }
validates :eula, acceptance: { accept: ["TRUE", "accepted"] }
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :email, confirmation: true
end
```

###### In your view template you could use something like

###### There is also a :case_sensitive option that you can use to define whether the confirmation constraint will be

###### case sensitive or not. This option defaults to true.

###### The default error message for this validator is "doesn't match confirmation". You can also pass in a custom

###### message via the message option.

###### Generally when using this validator, you will want to combine it with the :if option to only validate the

###### "_confirmation" field when the initial field has changed and not every time you save the record. More on

###### conditional validations later.

### 2.4. comparison

###### This validator will validate a comparison between any two comparable values.

```
<%= text_field :person, :email %>
<%= text_field :person, :email_confirmation %>
```
###### This check is performed only if email_confirmation is not nil. To require confirmation, make sure

###### to add a presence check for the confirmation attribute (we'll take a look at the presence check later

###### on in this guide):

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :email, confirmation: true
validates :email_confirmation, presence: true
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :email, confirmation: { case_sensitive: false }
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :email, confirmation: true
validates :email_confirmation, presence: true, if: :email_changed?
end
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 11 / 42


##### Page 12 of 42

###### The default error message for this validator is "failed comparison". You can also pass in a custom message via

###### the message option.

###### These options are all supported:

```
Option Description Default Error Message
```
```
:greater_than
```
###### Specifies the value must be greater than the

###### supplied value

###### "must be greater than %

###### c ount"

```
:greater_than_or_equal_to
```
###### Specifies the value must be greater than or

###### equal to the supplied value

###### "must be greater than or

###### equal to %c ount"

```
:equal_to
```
###### Specifies the value must be equal to the

###### supplied value "must be equal to %c ount"

```
:less_than
```
###### Specifies the value must be less than the

###### supplied value

###### "must be less than %c ount"

```
:less_than_or_equal_to
```
###### Specifies the value must be less than or equal

###### to the supplied value

###### "must be less than or equal to

###### %c ount"

```
:other_than
```
###### Specifies the value must be other than the

###### supplied value

###### "must be other than %

###### c ount"

### 2.5. format

###### This validator validates the attributes' values by testing whether they match a given regular expression, which is

###### specified using the :with option.

```
class Promotion < ApplicationRecord
validates :end_date, comparison: { greater_than: :start_date }
end
```
###### The validator requires a compare option be supplied. Each option accepts a value, proc, or symbol.

###### Any class that includes Comparable (https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Comparable.html) can

###### be compared.

```
class Product < ApplicationRecord
validates :legacy_code, format: { with: /\A[a-zA-Z]+\z/,
message: "only allows letters" }
end
```

###### Inversely, by using the :without option instead you can require that the specified attribute does not match the

###### regular expression.

###### In either case, the provided :with or :without option must be a regular expression or a proc or lambda that

###### returns one.

###### The default error message is "is invalid".

### 2.6. inclusion and exclusion

###### Both of these validators validate whether an attributeʼs value is included or excluded from a given set. The set can

###### be any enumerable object such as an array, range, or a dynamically generated collection using a proc, lambda, or

###### symbol.

###### inclusion ensures that the value is present in the set.

###### exclusion ensures that the value is not present in the set.

###### In both cases, the option :in receives the set of values, and :within can be used as an alias. For full options

###### on customizing error messages, see the message documentation.

###### If the enumerable is a numerical, time, or datetime range, the test is performed using Range#cover?, otherwise,

###### it uses include?. When using a proc or lambda, the instance under validation is passed as an argument,

###### allowing for dynamic validation.

#### 2.6.1. Examples

###### For inclusion:

###### For exclusion:

###### Use \A and \z to match the start and end of the string, ^ and $ match the start/end of a line. Due

###### to frequent misuse of ^ and $, you need to pass the multiline: true option in case you use any

###### of these two anchors in the provided regular expression. In most cases, you should be using \A and

###### \z.

```
class Coffee < ApplicationRecord
validates :size, inclusion: { in: %w(small medium large),
message: "%{value} is not a valid size" }
end
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 13 / 42


##### Page 14 of 42

###### Both validators allow the use of dynamic validation through methods that return an enumerable. Hereʼs an

###### example using a proc for inclusion:

###### Similarly, for exclusion:

### 2.7. length

###### This validator validates the length of the attributes' values. It provides a variety of options, so you can specify

###### length constraints in different ways:

###### The possible length constraint options are:

```
class Account < ApplicationRecord
validates :subdomain, exclusion: { in: %w(www us ca jp),
message: "%{value} is reserved." }
end
```
```
class Coffee < ApplicationRecord
validates :size, inclusion: { in: ->(coffee) { coffee.available_sizes } }
```
```
def available_sizes
%w(small medium large extra_large)
end
end
```
```
class Account < ApplicationRecord
validates :subdomain, exclusion: { in: ->(account) { account.reserved_subdomains } }
```
```
def reserved_subdomains
%w(www us ca jp admin)
end
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, length: { minimum: 2 }
validates :bio, length: { maximum: 500 }
validates :password, length: { in: 6 .. 20 }
validates :registration_number, length: { is: 6 }
end
```

```
Option Description
```
###### :minimum The attribute cannot have less than the specified length

###### :maximum The attribute cannot have more than the specified length

###### :in The attribute length must be included in a given interval T he value for this option must be a range

###### :is The attribute length must be equal to the given value

###### The default error messages depend on the type of length validation being performed. You can customize these

###### messages using the :wrong_length, :too_long, and :too_short options and %{count} as a placeholder for

###### the number corresponding to the length constraint being used. You can still use the :message option to specify

###### an error message.

### 2.8. numericality

###### This validator validates that your attributes have only numeric values. By default, it will match an optional sign

###### followed by an integer or floating point number.

###### To specify that only integer numbers are allowed, set :only_integer to true. Then it will use the following

###### regular expression to validate the attribute's value.

###### Otherwise, it will try to convert the value to a number using Float. Floats are converted to BigDecimal using

###### the column's precision value or a maximum of 15 digits.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :bio, length: { maximum: 1000 ,
too_long: "%{count} characters is the maximum allowed" }
end
```
###### The default error messages are plural (e.g. "is too short (minimum is %{count} characters)"). For this

###### reason, when :minimum is 1 you should provide a custom message or use presence: true instead.

###### Similarly, when :in or :within have a lower limit of 1, you should either provide a custom message

###### or call presence prior to length. Only one constraint option can be used at a time apart from the

###### :minimum and :maximum options which can be combined together.

```
/\A[+-]?\d+\z/
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 15 / 42


##### Page 16 of 42

###### The default error message for :only_integer is "must be an integer".

###### Besides :only_integer, this validator also accepts the :only_numeric option which specifies the value must

###### be an instance of Numeric and attempts to parse the value if it is a String.

###### The default error message when no options are specified is "is not a number".

###### There are also many options that can be used to add constraints to acceptable values:

```
Option Description Default Error Message
```
```
:greater_than
```
###### Specifies the value must be greater than the

###### supplied value

###### "must be greater than %

###### c ount"

```
:greater_than_or_equal_to
```
###### Specifies the value must be greater than or

###### equal to the supplied value

###### "must be greater than or

###### equal to %c ount"

```
:equal_to
```
###### Specifies the value must be equal to the

###### supplied value

###### Specifies the value must be in the supplied

###### range "must be in %c ount"

###### :odd Specifies the value must be an odd number "must be odd"

```
class Player < ApplicationRecord
validates :points, numericality: true
validates :games_played, numericality: { only_integer: true }
end
```
###### By default, numericality doesn't allow nil values. You can use allow_nil: true option to

###### permit it. For Integer and Float columns empty strings are converted to nil.


### 2.9. presence

###### This validator validates that the specified attributes are not empty. It uses the Object#blank?

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/Object.html#method-i-blank-3F method to check if the value is

###### either nil or a blank string - that is, a string that is either empty or consists of whitespace.

###### To check that an association is present, you'll need to test that the associated object is present, and not the

###### foreign key used to map the association. Testing the association will help you to determine that the foreign key is

###### not empty and also that the referenced object exists.

###### In cases where you use a custom :foreign_key or a :through association, it's important to explicitly set the

###### :inverse_of option to optimize the association lookup. This helps avoid unnecessary database queries during

###### validation.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, :login, :email, presence: true
end
```
```
person = Person.new(name: "Alice", login: "alice123", email: "alice@example.com")
person.valid?
=> true # presence validation passes
```
```
invalid_person = Person.new(name: "", login: nil, email: "bob@example.com")
invalid_person.valid?
=> false # presence validation fails
```
```
class Supplier < ApplicationRecord
has_one :account
validates :account, presence: true
end
```
```
irb> account = Account.create(name: "Account A")
```
```
irb> supplier = Supplier.new(account: account)
irb> supplier.valid?
=> true # presence validation passes
```
```
irb> invalid_supplier = Supplier.new
irb> invalid_supplier.valid?
=> false # presence validation fails
```

##### Page 18 of 42

###### For more details, check out the Bi-directional Associations documentation (association_basics.html#bi-

###### directional-associations).

###### If you validate the presence of an object associated via a has_one (association_basics.html#the-has-one-

###### association) or has_many (association_basics.html#the-has-many-association) relationship, it will check that

###### the object is neither blank? nor marked_for_destruction?.

###### Since false.blank? is true, if you want to validate the presence of a boolean field you should use one of the

###### following validations:

###### By using one of these validations, you will ensure the value will NOT be nil which would result in a NULL value

###### in most cases.

###### The default error message is "can't be blank".

### 2.10. uniqueness

###### This validator validates that the attribute's value is unique right before the object gets saved.

###### The validation happens by performing an SQL query into the model's table, searching for an existing record with

###### the same value in that attribute.

###### There is a :scope option that you can use to specify one or more attributes that are used to limit the uniqueness

###### check:

###### If you want to ensure that the association is both present and valid, you also need to use

###### validates_associated. More on that below.

```
# Value _must_ be true or false
validates :boolean_field_name, inclusion: [true, false]
# Value _must not_ be nil, aka true or false
validates :boolean_field_name, exclusion: [nil]
```
```
class Account < ApplicationRecord
validates :email, uniqueness: true
end
```
```
class Holiday < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, uniqueness: { scope: :year,
message: "should happen once per year" }
end
```

###### In order to add a uniqueness database constraint on your database, use the add_index

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements.html#method-

###### i-add_index) statement in a migration and include the unique: true option.

###### If you are using the :scope option in your uniqueness validation, and you wish to create a database constraint to

###### prevent possible violations of the uniqueness validation, you must create a unique index on both columns in your

###### database. See the MySQL manual (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/multiple-column-indexes.html) and

###### the MariaDB manual (https://mariadb.com/kb/en/compound-composite-indexes/) for more details about

###### multiple column indexes, or the PostgreSQL manual (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-

###### constraints.html) for examples of unique constraints that refer to a group of columns.

###### There is also a :case_sensitive option that you can use to define whether the uniqueness constraint will be

###### case sensitive, case insensitive, or if it should respect the default database collation. This option defaults to

###### respecting the default database collation.

###### A :conditions option can be used to specify additional conditions as a WHERE SQL fragment to limit the

###### uniqueness constraint lookup:

###### The default error message is "has already been taken".

###### See validates_uniqueness_of

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Validations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-

###### validates_uniqueness_of) for more information.

### 2.11. validates_associated

###### You should use this validator when your model has associations that always need to be validated. Every time you

###### try to save your object, valid? will be called on each one of the associated objects.

###### This validation does not create a uniqueness constraint in the database, so a scenario can occur

###### whereby two different database connections create two records with the same value for a column

###### that you intended to be unique. To avoid this, you must create a unique index on that column in your

###### database.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }
end
```
###### Some databases are configured to perform case-insensitive searches anyway.

```
validates :name, uniqueness: { conditions: -> { where(status: "active") } }
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 19 / 42


##### Page 20 of 42

###### This validation will work with all of the association types.

###### The default error message for validates_associated

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Validations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-

###### validates_associated) is "is invalid". Note that each associated object will contain its own errors collection;

###### errors do not bubble up to the calling model.

### 2.12. validates_each

###### This validator validates attributes against a block. It doesn't have a predefined validation function. You should

###### create one using a block, and every attribute passed to validates_each

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-

###### validates_each) will be tested against it.

###### In the following example, we will reject names and surnames that begin with lowercase.

###### The block receives the record, the attribute's name, and the attribute's value.

###### You can do anything you like to check for valid data within the block. If your validation fails, you should add an

###### error to the model, therefore making it invalid.

```
class Library < ApplicationRecord
has_many :books
validates_associated :books
end
```
###### Don't use validates_associated on both ends of your associations. They would call each other in

###### an infinite loop.

```
validates_associated
```
###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Validations/ClassMethods.html#method-

###### i-validates_associated) can only be used with ActiveRecord objects, everything up until now can also

###### be used on any object which includes ActiveModel::Validations

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations.html).

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates_each :name, :surname do |record, attr, value|
record.errors.add(attr, "must start with upper case") if /\A[[:lower:]]/.match?(value)
end
end
```

### 2.13. validates_with

###### This validator passes the record to a separate class for validation.

###### There is no default error message for validates_with. You must manually add errors to the record's errors

###### collection in the validator class.

###### To implement the validate method, you must accept a record parameter in the method definition, which is the

###### record to be validated.

###### If you want to add an error on a specific attribute, you can pass it as the first argument to the add method.

###### We will cover validation errors in greater detail later.

```
class AddressValidator < ActiveModel::Validator
def validate(record)
if record.house_number.blank?
record.errors.add :house_number, "is required"
end
```
```
if record.street.blank?
record.errors.add :street, "is required"
end
```
```
if record.postcode.blank?
record.errors.add :postcode, "is required"
end
end
end
```
```
class Invoice < ApplicationRecord
validates_with AddressValidator
end
```
###### Errors added to record.errors[:base] relate to the state of the record as a whole.

```
def validate(record)
if record.some_field != "acceptable"
record.errors.add :some_field, "this field is unacceptable"
end
end
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 21 / 42


##### Page 22 of 42

###### The validates_with

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-

###### validates_with) validator takes a class, or a list of classes to use for validation.

###### Like all other validations, validates_with takes the :if, :unless and :on options. If you pass any other

###### options, it will send those options to the validator class as options:

###### If your validator is complex enough that you want instance variables, you can easily use a plain old Ruby object

###### instead:

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates_with MyValidator, MyOtherValidator, on: :create
end
```
```
class AddressValidator < ActiveModel::Validator
def validate(record)
options[:fields].each do |field|
if record.send(field).blank?
record.errors.add field, "is required"
end
end
end
end
```
```
class Invoice < ApplicationRecord
validates_with AddressValidator, fields: [:house_number, :street, :postcode, :country]
end
```
###### The validator will be initialized only once for the whole application life cycle, and not on each

###### validation run, so be careful about using instance variables inside it.


###### We will cover custom validations more later.

## 3. Validation Options

###### There are several common options supported by the validators. These options are:

###### :allow_nil Skip validation if the attribute is nil.

###### :allow_blank Skip validation if the attribute is blank.

###### :message Specify a custom error message.

###### :on Specify the contexts where this validation is active.

###### :strict Raise an exception when the validation fails.

###### :if and :unless Specify when the validation should or should not occur.

```
class Invoice < ApplicationRecord
validate do |invoice|
AddressValidator.new(invoice).validate
end
end
```
```
class AddressValidator
def initialize(invoice)
@invoice = invoice
end
```
```
def validate
validate_field(:house_number)
validate_field(:street)
validate_field(:postcode)
end
```
```
private
def validate_field(field)
if @invoice.send(field).blank?
@invoice.errors.add field, "#{field.to_s.humanize} is required"
end
end
end
```
###### Not all of these options are supported by every validator, please refer to the API documentation for

```
ActiveModel::Validations
```
###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations.html).

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 23 / 42


##### Page 24 of 42

### 3.1. :allow_nil

###### The :allow_nil option skips the validation when the value being validated is nil.

###### For full options to the message argument please see the message documentation.

### 3.2. :allow_blank

###### The :allow_blank option is similar to the :allow_nil option. This option will let validation pass if the

###### attribute's value is blank?, like nil or an empty string for example.

### 3.3. :message

###### As you've already seen, the :message option lets you specify the message that will be added to the errors

###### collection when validation fails. When this option is not used, Active Record will use the respective default error

###### message for each validation.

###### The :message option accepts either a String or Proc as its value.

```
class Coffee < ApplicationRecord
validates :size, inclusion: { in: %w(small medium large),
message: "%{value} is not a valid size" }, allow_nil: true
end
```
```
irb> Coffee.create(size: nil).valid?
=> true
irb> Coffee.create(size: "mega").valid?
=> false
```
```
class Topic < ApplicationRecord
validates :title, length: { is: 6 }, allow_blank: true
end
```
```
irb> Topic.create(title: "").valid?
=> true
irb> Topic.create(title: nil).valid?
=> true
irb> Topic.create(title: "short").valid?
=> false # 'short' is not of length 6, so validation fails even though it's not blank
```

###### A String :message value can optionally contain any/all of %{value}, %{attribute}, and %{model} which

###### will be dynamically replaced when validation fails. This replacement is done using the i18n gem

###### (https://github.com/ruby-i18n/i18n) , and the placeholders must match exactly, no spaces are allowed.

###### A Proc :message value is given two arguments: the object being validated, and a hash with :model,

###### :attribute, and :value key-value pairs.

###### To translate error messages, see the I18n guide (i18n.html#error-message-scopes).

### 3.4. :on

###### The :on option lets you specify when the validation should happen. The default behavior for all the built-in

###### validations is to be run on save (both when you're creating a new record and when you're updating it). If you want

###### to change it, you can use on: :create to run the validation only when a new record is created or on: :update

###### to run the validation only when a record is updated.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
# Hard-coded message
validates :name, presence: { message: "must be given please" }
```
```
# Message with dynamic attribute value. %{value} will be replaced
# with the actual value of the attribute. %{attribute} and %{model}
# are also available.
validates :age, numericality: { message: "%{value} seems wrong" }
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :username,
uniqueness: {
# object = person object being validated
# data = { model: "Person", attribute: "Username", value: <username> }
message: ->(object, data) do
"Hey #{object.name}, #{data[:value]} is already taken."
end
}
end
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 25 / 42


##### Page 26 of 42

###### You can also use :on to define custom contexts. Custom contexts need to be triggered explicitly by passing the

###### name of the context to valid?, invalid?, or save.

###### person.valid?(:account_setup) executes both the validations without saving the model.

###### person.save(context: :account_setup) validates person in the account_setup context before saving.

###### Passing an array of symbols is also acceptable.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
# it will be possible to update email with a duplicated value
validates :email, uniqueness: true, on: :create
```
```
# it will be possible to create the record with a non-numerical age
validates :age, numericality: true, on: :update
```
```
# the default (validates on both create and update)
validates :name, presence: true
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :email, uniqueness: true, on: :account_setup
validates :age, numericality: true, on: :account_setup
end
```
```
irb> person = Person.new(age: 'thirty-three')
irb> person.valid?
=> true
irb> person.valid?(:account_setup)
=> false
irb> person.errors.messages
=> {:email=>["has already been taken"], :age=>["is not a number"]}
```
```
class Book
include ActiveModel::Validations
```
```
validates :title, presence: true, on: [:update, :ensure_title]
end
```

###### When triggered by an explicit context, validations are run for that context, as well as any validations without a

###### context.

###### You can read more about use-cases for :on in the Custom Contexts section.

## 4. Conditional Validations

###### Sometimes it will make sense to validate an object only when a given condition is met. You can do that by using

###### the :if and :unless options, which can take a symbol, a Proc or an Array. You may use the :if option

###### when you want to specify when the validation should happen. Alternatively, if you want to specify when the

###### validation should not happen, then you may use the :unless option.

### 4.1. Using a Symbol with :if and :unless

###### You can associate the :if and :unless options with a symbol corresponding to the name of a method that will

###### get called right before validation happens. This is the most commonly used option.

```
irb> book = Book.new(title: nil)
irb> book.valid?
=> true
irb> book.valid?(:ensure_title)
=> false
irb> book.errors.messages
=> {:title=>["can't be blank"]}
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :email, uniqueness: true, on: :account_setup
validates :age, numericality: true, on: :account_setup
validates :name, presence: true
end
```
```
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.valid?(:account_setup)
=> false
irb> person.errors.messages
=> {:email=>["has already been taken"], :age=>["is not a number"], :name=>["can't be
blank"]}
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 27 / 42


##### Page 28 of 42

### 4.2. Using a Proc with :if and :unless

###### It is possible to associate :if and :unless with a Proc object which will be called. Using a Proc object gives

###### you the ability to write an inline condition instead of a separate method. This option is best suited for one-liners.

###### As lambda is a type of Proc, it can also be used to write inline conditions taking advantage of the shortened

###### syntax.

### 4.3. Grouping Conditional Validations

###### Sometimes it is useful to have multiple validations use one condition. It can be easily achieved using

###### with_options (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/Object.html#method-i-with_options).

###### All validations inside of the with_options block will automatically have if:

###### :is_admin? merged into its options.

```
class Order < ApplicationRecord
validates :card_number, presence: true, if: :paid_with_card?
```
```
def paid_with_card?
payment_type == "card"
end
end
```
```
class Account < ApplicationRecord
validates :password, confirmation: true,
unless: Proc.new { |a| a.password.blank? }
end
```
```
validates :password, confirmation: true, unless: -> { password.blank? }
```
```
class User < ApplicationRecord
with_options if: :is_admin? do |admin|
admin.validates :password, length: { minimum: 10 }
admin.validates :email, presence: true
end
end
```

### 4.4. Combining Validation Conditions

###### On the other hand, when multiple conditions define whether or not a validation should happen, an Array can be

###### used. Moreover, you can apply both :if and :unless to the same validation.

###### The validation only runs when all the :if conditions and none of the :unless conditions are evaluated to true.

## 5. Strict Validations

###### You can also specify validations to be strict and raise ActiveModel::StrictValidationFailed when the object

###### is invalid.

###### Strict validations ensure that an exception is raised immediately when validation fails, which can be useful in

###### situations where you want to enforce immediate feedback or halt processing when invalid data is encountered.

###### For example, you might use strict validations in a scenario where invalid input should prevent further operations,

###### such as when processing critical transactions or performing data integrity checks.

###### There is also the ability to pass a custom exception to the :strict option.

```
class Computer < ApplicationRecord
validates :mouse, presence: true,
if: [Proc.new { |c| c.market.retail? }, :desktop?],
unless: Proc.new { |c| c.trackpad.present? }
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, presence: { strict: true }
end
```
```
irb> Person.new.valid?
=> ActiveModel::StrictValidationFailed: Name can't be blank
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :token, presence: true, uniqueness: true, strict: TokenGenerationException
end
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 29 / 42


##### Page 30 of 42

## 6. Listing Validators

###### If you want to find out all of the validators for a given object, you can use validators.

###### For example, if we have the following model using a custom validator and a built-in validator:

###### We can now use validators on the "Person" model to list all validators, or even check a specific field using

###### validators_on.

## 7. Performing Custom Validations

###### When the built-in validations are not enough for your needs, you can write your own validators or validation

###### methods as you prefer.

```
irb> Person.new.valid?
=> TokenGenerationException: Token can't be blank
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, presence: true, on: :create
validates :email, format: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP
validates_with MyOtherValidator, strict: true
end
```
```
irb> Person.validators
#=> [#<ActiveRecord::Validations::PresenceValidator:0x10b2f2158
@attributes=[:name], @options={:on=>:create}>,
#<MyOtherValidatorValidator:0x10b2f17d0
@attributes=[:name], @options={:strict=>true}>,
#<ActiveModel::Validations::FormatValidator:0x10b2f0f10
@attributes=[:email],
@options={:with=>URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP}>]
#<MyOtherValidator:0x10b2f0948 @options={:strict=>true}>]
```
```
irb> Person.validators_on(:name)
#=> [#<ActiveModel::Validations::PresenceValidator:0x10b2f2158
@attributes=[:name], @options={on: :create}>]
```

### 7.1. Custom Validators

###### Custom validators are classes that inherit from ActiveModel::Validator

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validator.html). These classes must implement the

###### validate method which takes a record as an argument and performs the validation on it. The custom validator is

###### called using the validates_with method.

###### The easiest way to add custom validators for validating individual attributes is with the convenient

###### ActiveModel::EachValidator (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/EachValidator.html).

###### In this case, the custom validator class must implement a validate_each method which takes three arguments:

###### record, attribute, and value. These correspond to the instance, the attribute to be validated, and the value of the

###### attribute in the passed instance.

###### As shown in the example, you can also combine standard validations with your own custom validators.

```
class MyValidator < ActiveModel::Validator
def validate(record)
unless record.name.start_with? "X"
record.errors.add :name, "Provide a name starting with X, please!"
end
end
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates_with MyValidator
end
```
```
class EmailValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
def validate_each(record, attribute, value)
unless URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP.match?(value)
record.errors.add attribute, (options[:message] || "is not an email")
end
end
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :email, presence: true, email: true
end
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html 31 / 42


##### Page 32 of 42

### 7.2. Custom Methods

###### You can also create methods that verify the state of your models and add errors to the errors collection when

###### they are invalid. You must then register these methods by using the validate

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-validate)

###### class method, passing in the symbols for the validation methods' names.

###### You can pass more than one symbol for each class method and the respective validations will be run in the same

###### order as they were registered.

###### The valid? method will verify that the errors collection is empty, so your custom validation methods should

###### add errors to it when you wish validation to fail:

###### By default, such validations will run every time you call valid? or save the object. But it is also possible to

###### control when to run these custom validations by giving an :on option to the validate method, with either:

###### :create or :update.

###### See the section above for more details about :on.

```
class Invoice < ApplicationRecord
validate :expiration_date_cannot_be_in_the_past,
:discount_cannot_be_greater_than_total_value
```
```
def expiration_date_cannot_be_in_the_past
if expiration_date.present? && expiration_date < Date.today
errors.add(:expiration_date, "can't be in the past")
end
end
```
```
def discount_cannot_be_greater_than_total_value
if discount > total_value
errors.add(:discount, "can't be greater than total value")
end
end
end
```
```
class Invoice < ApplicationRecord
validate :active_customer, on: :create
```
```
def active_customer
errors.add(:customer_id, "is not active") unless customer.active?
end
end
```

### 7.3. Custom Contexts

###### You can define your own custom validation contexts for callbacks, which is useful when you want to perform

###### validations based on specific scenarios or group certain callbacks together and run them in a specific context. A

###### common scenario for custom contexts is when you have a multi-step form and want to perform validations per

###### step.

###### For instance, you might define custom contexts for each step of the form:

###### In these cases, you may be tempted to skip callbacks (active_record_callbacks.html#skipping-callbacks)

###### altogether, but defining a custom context can be a more structured approach. You will need to combine a context

###### with the :on option to define a custom context for a callback.

###### Once you've defined the custom context, you can use it to trigger the validations:

```
class User < ApplicationRecord
validate :personal_information, on: :personal_info
validate :contact_information, on: :contact_info
validate :location_information, on: :location_info
```
```
private
def personal_information
errors.add(:base, "Name must be present") if first_name.blank?
errors.add(:base, "Age must be at least 18") if age && age < 18
end
```
```
def contact_information
errors.add(:base, "Email must be present") if email.blank?
errors.add(:base, "Phone number must be present") if phone.blank?
end
```
```
def location_information
errors.add(:base, "Address must be present") if address.blank?
errors.add(:base, "City must be present") if city.blank?
end
end
```

## 8. Working with Validation Errors

###### The valid? (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Validations.html#method-i-valid-3F

###### and invalid? (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations.html#method-i-invalid-

###### 3F methods only provide a summary status on validity. However you can dig deeper into each individual error by

###### using various methods from the errors

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations.html#method-i-errors) collection.

###### The following is a list of the most commonly used methods. Please refer to the ActiveModel::Errors

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Errors.html) documentation for a list of all the available

###### methods.

### 8.1. errors

###### The errors (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Validations.html#method-i-errors)

###### method is the starting point through which you can drill down into various details of each error.

###### This returns an instance of the class ActiveModel::Errors containing all errors, each error is represented by

###### an ActiveModel::Error (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Error.html) object.

```
irb> user = User.new(name: "John Doe", age: 17 , email: "jane@example.com", phone:
"1234567890", address: "123 Main St")
irb> user.save(context: :personal_info) # => false
irb> user.save(context: :contact_info) # => true
irb> user.save(context: :location_info) # => false
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3 }
end
```

### 8.2. errors[]

###### errors[] (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Errors.html#method-i-5B5D is used

###### when you want to check the error messages for a specific attribute. It returns an array of strings with all error

###### messages for the given attribute, each string with one error message. If there are no errors related to the

###### attribute, it returns an empty array.

###### This method is only useful after validations have been run, because it only inspects the errors collection and

###### does not trigger validations itself. It's different from the ActiveRecord::Base#invalid? method explained

###### above because it doesn't verify the validity of the object as a whole. errors[] only checks to see whether there

###### are errors found on an individual attribute of the object.

```
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.valid?
=> false
irb> person.errors.full_messages
=> ["Name can't be blank", "Name is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"]
```
```
irb> person = Person.new(name: "John Doe")
irb> person.valid?
=> true
irb> person.errors.full_messages
=> []
```
```
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.valid?
=> false
irb> person.errors.first.details
=> {:error=>:too_short, :count=> 3 }
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3 }
end
```

### 8.3. errors.where and Error Object

###### Sometimes we may need more information about each error besides its message. Each error is encapsulated as

###### an ActiveModel::Error object, and the where

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Errors.html#method-i-where) method is the most

###### common way of access.

###### where returns an array of error objects filtered by various degrees of conditions.

###### Given the following validation:

###### We can filter for just the attribute by passing it as the first parameter to errors.where(:attr). The second

###### parameter is used for filtering the type of error we want by calling errors.where(:attr, :type).

```
irb> person = Person.new(name: "John Doe")
irb> person.valid?
=> true
irb> person.errors[:name]
=> []
```
```
irb> person = Person.new(name: "JD")
irb> person.valid?
=> false
irb> person.errors[:name]
=> ["is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"]
```
```
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.valid?
=> false
irb> person.errors[:name]
=> ["can't be blank", "is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"]
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3 }
end
```

###### Lastly, we can filter by any options that may exist on the given type of error object.

###### You can read various information from these error objects:

###### You can also generate the error message:

###### The full_message (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Errors.html#method-i-

###### full_message) method generates a more user-friendly message, with the capitalized attribute name prepended.

###### To customize the format that full_message uses, see the I18n guide (i18n.html#active-model-methods) .)

```
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.valid?
=> false
```
```
irb> person.errors.where(:name)
=> [ ... ] # all errors for :name attribute
```
```
irb> person.errors.where(:name, :too_short)
=> [ ... ] # :too_short errors for :name attribute
```
```
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.valid?
=> false
```
```
irb> person.errors.where(:name, :too_short, minimum: 3 )
=> [ ... ] # all name errors being too short and minimum is 3
```
```
irb> error = person.errors.where(:name).last
```
```
irb> error.attribute
=> :name
irb> error.type
=> :too_short
irb> error.options[:count]
=> 3
```
```
irb> error.message
=> "is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"
irb> error.full_message
=> "Name is too short (minimum is 3 characters)"
```

### 8.4. errors.add

###### The add (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Errors.html#method-i-add) method creates

###### the error object by taking the attribute, the error type and additional options hash. This is useful when writing

###### your own validator, as it lets you define very specific error situations.

### 8.5. errors[:base]

###### You can add errors that are related to the object's state as a whole, instead of being related to a specific attribute.

###### To do this you must use :base as the attribute when adding a new error.

### 8.6. errors.size

###### The size method returns the total number of errors for the object.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validate do |person|
errors.add :name, :too_plain, message: "is not cool enough"
end
end
```
```
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.errors.where(:name).first.type
=> :too_plain
irb> person.errors.where(:name).first.full_message
=> "Name is not cool enough"
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validate do |person|
errors.add :base, :invalid, message: "This person is invalid because ..."
end
end
```
```
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.errors.where(:base).first.full_message
=> "This person is invalid because ..."
```

### 8.7. errors.clear

###### The clear method is used when you intentionally want to clear the errors collection. Of course, calling

###### errors.clear upon an invalid object won't actually make it valid: the errors collection will now be empty, but

###### the next time you call valid? or any method that tries to save this object to the database, the validations will run

###### again. If any of the validations fail, the errors collection will be filled again.

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3 }
end
```
```
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.valid?
=> false
irb> person.errors.size
=> 2
```
```
irb> person = Person.new(name: "Andrea", email: "andrea@example.com")
irb> person.valid?
=> true
irb> person.errors.size
=> 0
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3 }
end
```

## 9. Displaying Validation Errors in Views

###### Once you've defined a model and added validations, you'll want to display an error message when a validation

###### fails during the creation of that model via a web form.

###### Since every application handles displaying validation errors differently, Rails does not include any view helpers

###### for generating these messages. However, Rails gives you a rich number of methods to interact with validations

###### that you can use to build your own. In addition, when generating a scaffold, Rails will put some generated ERB

###### into the _form.html.erb that displays the full list of errors on that model.

###### Assuming we have a model that's been saved in an instance variable named @article, it looks like this:

###### Furthermore, if you use the Rails form helpers to generate your forms, when a validation error occurs on a field, it

###### will generate an extra <div> around the entry.

```
irb> person = Person.new
irb> person.valid?
=> false
irb> person.errors.empty?
=> false
```
```
irb> person.errors.clear
irb> person.errors.empty?
=> true
```
```
irb> person.save
=> false
```
```
irb> person.errors.empty?
=> false
```
```
<% if @article.errors.any? %>
<div id="error_explanation">
<h2><%= pluralize(@article.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this article from
being saved:</h2>
```
```
<ul>
<% @article.errors.each do |error| %>
<li><%= error.full_message %></li>
<% end %>
</ul>
</div>
<% end %>
```

###### You can then style this div however you'd like. The default scaffold that Rails generates, for example, adds this

###### CSS rule:

###### This means that any field with an error ends up with a 2 pixel red border.

### 9.1. Customizing Error Field Wrapper

###### Rails uses the field_error_proc configuration option to wrap fields with errors in HTML. By default, this option

###### wraps the erroneous form fields in a <div> with a field_with_errors class, as seen in the example above:

###### You can customize this behavior by modifying the field_error_proc setting in your application configuration,

###### allowing you to change how errors are presented in your forms. For more details, refer to the Configuration

###### Guide on field_error_proc (configuring.html#config-action-view-field-error-proc).
