# Action View Form Helpers

###### Forms are a common interface for user input in web applications. However, form markup can be tedious to write

###### and maintain because of the need to handle form controls, naming, and attributes. Rails simplifies this by

###### providing view helpers, which are methods that output HTML form markup. This guide will help you understand

###### the different helper methods and when to use each.

###### After reading this guide, you will know:

###### How to create basic forms, such as a search form.

###### How to work with model-based forms for creating and editing specific database records.

###### How to generate select boxes from multiple types of data.

###### What date and time helpers Rails provides.

###### What makes a file upload form different.

###### How to post forms to external resources and specify setting an authenticity_token.

###### How to build complex forms.

###### This guide is not intended to be a complete list of all available form helpers. Please refer to the Rails API

###### documentation (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers.html) for an exhaustive list of

###### form helpers and their arguments.

## 1. Working with Basic Forms

###### The main form helper is form_with

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-form_with).

###### When called without arguments, it creates an HTML <form> tag with the value of the method attribute set to

###### post and the value of the action attribute set to the current page. For example, assuming the current page is

###### a home page at /home, the generated HTML will look like this:

```
<%= form_with do |form| %>
Form contents
<% end %>
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 1 / 36


##### Page 2 of 36

###### Notice that the form contains an input element with type hidden. This authenticity_token hidden input is

###### required for non-GET form submissions. This token is a security feature in Rails used to prevent cross-site

###### request forgery CSRF attacks, and form helpers automatically generate it for every non-GET form (assuming

###### the security feature is enabled). You can read more about it in the Securing Rails Applications

###### (security.html#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf) guide.

### 1.1. A Generic Search Form

###### One of the most basic forms on the web is a search form. This form contains:

###### a form element with "GET" method,

###### a label for the input,

###### a text input element, and

###### a submit element.

###### Here is how to create a search form with form_with:

###### This will generate the following HTML

###### Notice that for the search form we are using the url option of form_with. Setting url: "/search" changes

###### the form action value from the default current page path to action="/search".

```
<form action="/home" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="Lz6ILqUEs2CGdDa-
oz38TqcqQORavGnbGkG0CQA8zc8peOps-K7sHgFSTPSkBx89pQxh3p5zPIkjoOTiA_UWbQ"
autocomplete="off">
Form contents
</form>
```
```
<%= form_with url: "/search", method: :get do |form| %>
<%= form.label :query, "Search for:" %>
<%= form.search_field :query %>
<%= form.submit "Search" %>
<% end %>
```
```
<form action="/search" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="get">
<label for="query">Search for:</label>
<input type="search" name="query" id="query">
<input type="submit" name="commit" value="Search" data-disable-with="Search">
</form>
```

###### In general, passing url: my_path to form_with tells the form where to make the request. The other option is

###### to pass Active Model objects to the form, as you will learn below. You can also use URL helpers

###### (routing.html#path-and-url-helpers).

###### The search form example above also shows the form builder

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html) object. You will learn about

###### the many helpers provided by the form builder object (likeform.label and form.text_field) in the next

###### section.

### 1.2. Helpers for Generating Form Elements

###### The form builder object yielded by form_with provides many helper methods for generating common form

###### elements such as text fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

###### The first argument to these methods is always the name of the input. This is useful to remember because when

###### the form is submitted, that name will be passed to the controller along with the form data in the params hash.

###### The name will be the key in the params for the value entered by the user for that field.

###### For example, if the form contains <%= form.text_field :query %>, then you would be able to get the value

###### of this field in the controller with params[:query].

###### When naming inputs, Rails uses certain conventions that make it possible to submit parameters with non-scalar

###### values such as arrays or hashes, which will also be accessible in params. You can read more about them in the

###### Form Input Naming Conventions and Params Hash section of this guide. For details on the precise usage of

###### these helpers, please refer to the API documentation

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper.html).

#### 1.2.1. Checkboxes

###### A Checkbox is a form control that allows for a single value to be selected or deselected. A group of Checkboxes

###### is generally used to allow a user to choose one or more options from the group.

###### Here's an example with three checkboxes in a form:

###### For every form input element, an id attribute is generated from its name ("query" in above

###### example). These IDs can be very useful for CSS styling or manipulation of form controls with

###### JavaScript.

###### Use "GET" as the method for search forms. In general, Rails conventions encourage using the right

###### HTTP verb for controller actions. Using "GET" for search allows users to bookmark a specific

###### search.

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 3 / 36


##### Page 4 of 36

###### The above will generate the following:

###### The first parameter to checkbox

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-checkbox) is

###### the name of the input which can be found in the params hash. If the user has checked the "Biography"

###### checkbox only, the params hash would contain:

###### You can use params[:biography] to check if that checkbox is selected by the user.

###### The checkbox's values (the values that will appear in params) can optionally be specified using the

###### checked_value and unchecked_value parameters. See the API documentation

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-checkbox) for

###### more details.

###### There is also a collection_checkboxes, which you can learn about in the Collection Related Helpers section.

#### 1.2.2. Radio Buttons

###### Radio buttons are form controls that only allow the user to select one option at a time from the list of choices.

```
<%= form.checkbox :biography %>
<%= form.label :biography, "Biography" %>
<%= form.checkbox :romance %>
<%= form.label :romance, "Romance" %>
<%= form.checkbox :mystery %>
<%= form.label :mystery, "Mystery" %>
```
```
<input name="biography" type="hidden" value="0" autocomplete="off"><input type="checkbox"
value="1" name="biography" id="biography">
<label for="biography">Biography</label>
<input name="romance" type="hidden" value="0" autocomplete="off"><input type="checkbox"
value="1" name="romance" id="romance">
<label for="romance">Romance</label>
<input name="mystery" type="hidden" value="0" autocomplete="off"><input type="checkbox"
value="1" name="mystery" id="mystery">
<label for="mystery">Mystery</label>
```
```
{
"biography" => "1",
"romance" => "0",
"mystery" => "0"
}
```

###### For example, radio buttons for choosing your favorite ice cream flavor:

###### The above will generate the following HTML

###### The second argument to radio_button

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-radio_button) is

###### the value of the input. Because these radio buttons share the same name (flavor), the user will only be able to

###### select one of them, and params[:flavor] will contain either "chocolate_chip", "vanilla", or hazelnut.

### 1.3. Other Helpers of Interest

###### There are many other form controls including text, email, password, date, and time. The below examples show

###### some more helpers and their generated HTML.

###### Date and time related helpers:

```
<%= form.radio_button :flavor, "chocolate_chip" %>
<%= form.label :flavor_chocolate_chip, "Chocolate Chip" %>
<%= form.radio_button :flavor, "vanilla" %>
<%= form.label :flavor_vanilla, "Vanilla" %>
<%= form.radio_button :flavor, "hazelnut" %>
<%= form.label :flavor_hazelnut, "Hazelnut" %>
```
```
<input type="radio" value="chocolate_chip" name="flavor" id="flavor_chocolate_chip">
<label for="flavor_chocolate_chip">Chocolate Chip</label>
<input type="radio" value="vanilla" name="flavor" id="flavor_vanilla">
<label for="flavor_vanilla">Vanilla</label>
<input type="radio" value="hazelnut" name="flavor" id="flavor_hazelnut">
<label for="flavor_hazelnut">Hazelnut</label>
```
###### Always use labels for checkbox and radio buttons. They associate text with a specific option using

###### the for attribute and, by expanding the clickable region, make it easier for users to click the inputs.

```
<%= form.date_field :born_on %>
<%= form.time_field :started_at %>
<%= form.datetime_local_field :graduation_day %>
<%= form.month_field :birthday_month %>
<%= form.week_field :birthday_week %>
```

<input type="search" name="name" id="name">
<input value="#000000" type="color" name="favorite_color" id="favorite_color">
```

###### Hidden inputs are not shown to the user but instead hold data like any textual input. Values inside them can be

###### changed with JavaScript.

## 2. Creating Forms with Model Objects

### 2.1. Binding a Form to an Object

###### The form_with helper has a :model option that allows you to bind the form builder object to a model object.

###### This means that the form will be scoped to that model object, and the form's fields will be populated with values

###### from that model object.

###### For example, if we have a @book model object:

###### And the following form to create a new book:

###### It will generate this HTML

###### If you're using password input fields, you might want to configure your application to prevent those

###### parameters from being logged. You can learn about how in the Securing Rails Applications

###### (security.html#logging) guide.

```
@book = Book.new
# => #<Book id: nil, title: nil, author: nil>
```
```
<%= form_with model: @book do |form| %>
<div>
<%= form.label :title %>
<%= form.text_field :title %>
</div>
<div>
<%= form.label :author %>
<%= form.text_field :author %>
</div>
<%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 7 / 36


##### Page 8 of 36

###### Some important things to notice when using form_with with a model object:

###### The form action is automatically filled with an appropriate value, action="/books". If you were

###### updating a book, it would be action="/books/42".

###### The form field names are scoped with book[...]. This means that params[:book] will be a hash

###### containing all these field's values. You can read more about the significance of input names in chapter

###### Form Input Naming Conventions and Params Hash of this guide.

###### The submit button is automatically given an appropriate text value, "Create Book" in this case.

#### 2.1.1. Composite Primary Key Forms

###### If you have a model with a composite primary key (active_record_composite_primary_keys.html) , the form

###### building syntax is the same with slightly different output.

###### For example, to update a @book model object with a composite key [:author_id, :id] like this:

###### The following form:

```
<form action="/books" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token"
value="ChwHeyegcpAFDdBvXvDuvbfW7yCA3e8gvhyieai7DhG28C3akh-dyuv-
IBittsjPrIjETlQQvQJ91T77QQ8xWA" autocomplete="off">
<div>
<label for="book_title">Title</label>
<input type="text" name="book[title]" id="book_title">
</div>
<div>
<label for="book_author">Author</label>
<input type="text" name="book[author]" id="book_author">
</div>
<input type="submit" name="commit" value="Create Book" data-disable-with="Create Book">
</form>
```
###### Typically your form inputs will mirror model attributes. However, they don't have to. If there is other

###### information you need you can include a field in your form and access it via params[:book]

###### [:my_non_attribute_input].

```
@book = Book.find([ 2 , 25 ])
# => #<Book id: 25, title: "Some book", author_id: 2>
```

###### Will generate this HTML output:

###### Note the generated URL contains the author_id and id delimited by an underscore. Once submitted, the

###### controller can extract each primary key value (action_controller_overview.html#composite-key-parameters)

###### from the parameters and update the record as it would with a singular primary key.

#### 2.1.2. The fields_for Helper

###### The fields_for helper is used to render fields for related model objects within the same form. The associated

###### "inner" model is usually related to the "main" form model via an Active Record association. For example, if you

###### had a Person model with an associated ContactDetail model, you could create a single form with inputs for

###### both models like so:

###### The above will produce the following output:

```
<%= form_with model: @book do |form| %>
<%= form.text_field :title %>
<%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
```
```
<form action="/books/2_25" method="post" accept-charset="UTF-8" >
<input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden"
value="ChwHeyegcpAFDdBvXvDuvbfW7yCA3e8gvhyieai7DhG28C3akh-dyuv-
IBittsjPrIjETlQQvQJ91T77QQ8xWA" />
<input type="text" name="book[title]" id="book_title" value="Some book" />
<input type="submit" name="commit" value="Update Book" data-disable-with="Update Book">
</form>
```
```
<%= form_with model: @person do |person_form| %>
<%= person_form.text_field :name %>
<%= fields_for :contact_detail, @person.contact_detail do |contact_detail_form| %>
<%= contact_detail_form.text_field :phone_number %>
<% end %>
<% end %>
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 9 / 36


##### Page 10 of 36

###### The object yielded by fields_for is a form builder like the one yielded by form_with. The fields_for

###### helper creates a similar binding but without rendering a <form> tag. You can learn more about fields_for in

###### the API docs (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-

###### fields_for).

### 2.2. Relying on Record Identification

###### When dealing with RESTful resources, calls to form_with can be simplified by relying on record identification.

###### This means you pass the model instance and have Rails figure out the model name, method, and other things. In

###### the example below for creating a new record, both calls to form_with generate the same HTML

###### Similarly, for editing an existing article like below, both the calls to form_with will also generate the same

###### HTML

###### Notice how the short-hand form_with invocation is conveniently the same, regardless of the record being new

###### or existing. Record identification is smart enough to figure out if the record is new by asking

###### record.persisted? (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-

###### persisted-3F. It also selects the correct path to submit to, and the name based on the class of the object.

###### This is assuming that the Article model is declared with resources :articles in the routes file.

###### If you have a singular resource (routing.html#singular-resources) , you will need to call resource and

###### resolve for it to work with form_with:

```
<form action="/people" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="..." autocomplete="off" />
<input type="text" name="person[name]" id="person_name" />
<input type="text" name="contact_detail[phone_number]" id="contact_detail_phone_number"
/>
</form>
```
```
# longer way:
form_with(model: @article, url: articles_path)
# short-hand:
form_with(model: @article)
```
```
# longer way:
form_with(model: @article, url: article_path(@article), method: "patch")
# short-hand:
form_with(model: @article)
```

### 2.3. Working with Namespaces

###### If you have namespaced routes, form_with has a shorthand for that. For example, if your application has an

###### admin namespace:

###### The above will create a form that submits to the Admin::ArticlesController inside the admin namespace,

###### therefore submitting to admin_article_path(@article) in the case of an update.

###### If you have several levels of namespacing then the syntax is similar:

###### For more information on Rails' routing system and the associated conventions, please see the Rails Routing

###### from the Outside In (routing.html) guide.

### 2.4. Forms with PATCH, PUT, or DELETE Methods

###### The Rails framework encourages RESTful design, which means forms in your application will make requests

###### where the method is PATCH, PUT, or DELETE in addition to GET and POST. However, HTML forms don't

###### support methods other than GET and POST when it comes to submitting forms.

###### Rails works around this limitation by emulating other methods over POST with a hidden input named

###### "_method". For example:

```
resource :article
resolve("Article") { [:article] }
```
###### Declaring a resource has a number of side effects. See the Rails Routing from the Outside In

###### (routing.html#resource-routing-the-rails-default) guide for more information on setting up and

###### using resources.

###### When you're using single-table inheritance (association_basics.html#single-table-inheritance-

###### sti) with your models, you can't rely on record identification on a subclass if only their parent class is

###### declared a resource. You will have to specify :url, and :scope (the model name) explicitly.

```
form_with model: [:admin, @article]
```
```
form_with model: [:admin, :management, @article]
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 11 / 36


##### Page 12 of 36

###### The above form Will generate this HTML output:

###### When parsing POSTed data, Rails will take into account the special _method parameter and proceed as if the

###### request's HTTP method was the one set as the value of _method (PATCH in this example).

###### When rendering a form, submission buttons can override the declared method attribute through the

###### formmethod: keyword:

###### Similar to <form> elements, most browsers don't support overriding form methods declared through

###### formmethod (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#attr-formmethod) other

###### than GET and POST.

###### Rails works around this issue by emulating other methods over POST through a combination of formmethod

###### (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#attr-formmethod) , value

###### (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#attr-value) , and name

###### (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#attr-name) attributes:

```
form_with(url: search_path, method: "patch")
```
```
<form action="/search" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="patch" autocomplete="off">
<input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="R4quRuXQAq75TyWpSf8AwRyLt-
R1uMtPP1dHTTWJE5zbukiaY8poSTXxq3Z7uAjXfPHiKQDsWE1i2_-h0HSktQ" autocomplete="off">
<!-- ... -->
</form>
```
```
<%= form_with url: "/posts/1", method: :patch do |form| %>
<%= form.button "Delete", formmethod: :delete, data: { confirm: "Are you sure?" } %>
<%= form.button "Update" %>
<% end %>
```
```
<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/posts/1" method="post">
<input name="_method" type="hidden" value="patch" />
<input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden"
value="f755bb0ed134b76c432144748a6d4b7a7ddf2b71" />
<!-- ... -->
```
```
<button type="submit" formmethod="post" name="_method" value="delete" data-confirm="Are
you sure?">Delete</button>
<button type="submit" name="button">Update</button>
</form>
```

###### In this case, the "Update" button will be treated as PATCH and the "Delete" button will be treated as DELETE.

## 3. Making Select Boxes with Ease

###### Select boxes, also known as drop-down list, allow users to select from a list of options. The HTML for select

###### boxes requires a decent amount of markup - one <option> element for each option to choose from. Rails

###### provides helper methods to help generate that markup.

###### For example, let's say we have a list of cities for the user to choose from. We can use the select

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-select) helper:

###### The above will generate this HTML output:

###### And the selection will be available in params[:city] as usual.

###### We can also specify <option> values that differ from their labels:

###### Output:

###### This way, the user will see the full city name, but params[:city] will be one of "BE", "CHI", or "MD".

###### Lastly, we can specify a default choice for the select box with the :selected argument:

```
<%= form.select :city, ["Berlin", "Chicago", "Madrid"] %>
```
```
<select name="city" id="city">
<option value="Berlin">Berlin</option>
<option value="Chicago">Chicago</option>
<option value="Madrid">Madrid</option>
</select>
```
```
<%= form.select :city, [["Berlin", "BE"], ["Chicago", "CHI"], ["Madrid", "MD"]] %>
```
```
<select name="city" id="city">
<option value="BE">Berlin</option>
<option value="CHI">Chicago</option>
<option value="MD">Madrid</option>
</select>
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 13 / 36


##### Page 14 of 36

###### Output:

### 3.1. Option Groups for Select Boxes

###### In some cases we may want to improve the user experience by grouping related options together. We can do so

###### by passing a Hash (or comparable Array) to select:

###### Output:

```
<%= form.select :city, [["Berlin", "BE"], ["Chicago", "CHI"], ["Madrid", "MD"]],
selected: "CHI" %>
```
```
<select name="city" id="city">
<option value="BE">Berlin</option>
<option value="CHI" selected="selected">Chicago</option>
<option value="MD">Madrid</option>
</select>
```
```
<%= form.select :city,
{
"Europe" => [ ["Berlin", "BE"], ["Madrid", "MD"] ],
"North America" => [ ["Chicago", "CHI"] ],
},
selected: "CHI" %>
```
```
<select name="city" id="city">
<optgroup label="Europe">
<option value="BE">Berlin</option>
<option value="MD">Madrid</option>
</optgroup>
<optgroup label="North America">
<option value="CHI" selected="selected">Chicago</option>
</optgroup>
</select>
```

### 3.2. Binding Select Boxes to Model Objects

###### Like other form controls, a select box can be bound to a model attribute. For example, if we have a @person

###### model object like:

###### The following form:

###### Will output this select box:

###### The only difference is that the selected option will be found in params[:person][:city] instead of

###### params[:city].

###### Notice that the appropriate option was automatically marked selected="selected". Since this select box was

###### bound to an existing @person record, we didn't need to specify a :selected argument.

## 4. Using Date and Time Form Helpers

###### In addition to the date_field and time_field helpers mentioned earlier , Rails provides alternative date and

###### time form helpers that render plain select boxes. The date_select helper renders a separate select box for

###### year, month, and day.

###### For example, if we have a @person model object like:

```
@person = Person.new(city: "MD")
```
```
<%= form_with model: @person do |form| %>
<%= form.select :city, [["Berlin", "BE"], ["Chicago", "CHI"], ["Madrid", "MD"]] %>
<% end %>
```
```
<select name="person[city]" id="person_city">
<option value="BE">Berlin</option>
<option value="CHI">Chicago</option>
<option value="MD" selected="selected">Madrid</option>
</select>
```
```
@person = Person.new(birth_date: Date.new( 1995 , 12 , 21 ))
```

##### Page 16 of 36

###### The following form:

###### Will output select boxes like:

```

<option value="31"> 31 </option>
</select>
```

###### Notice that, when the form is submitted, there will be no single value in the params hash that contains the full

###### date. Instead, there will be several values with special names like "birth_date(1i)". However, Active Model

###### knows how to assemble these values into a full date, based on the declared type of the model attribute. So we

###### can pass params[:person] to Person.new or Person#update just like we would if the form used a single

###### field to represent the full date.

###### In addition to the date_select

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-date_select)

###### helper, Rails provides time_select

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-time_select)

###### which outputs select boxes for the hour and minute. There is datetime_select

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-

###### datetime_select) as well which combines both date and time select boxes.

### 4.1. Select Boxes for Time or Date Components

###### Rails also provides helpers to render select boxes for individual date and time components: select_year

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html#method-i-select_year) ,

###### select_month (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html#method-i-

###### select_month) , select_day

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html#method-i-select_day) ,

###### select_hour (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html#method-i-

###### select_hour) , select_minute

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html#method-i-select_minute) ,

###### and select_second

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html#method-i-select_second).

###### These helpers are "bare" methods, meaning they are not called on a form builder instance. For example:

###### The above outputs a select box like:

```
<%= select_year 2024 , prefix: "party" %>
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 17 / 36


##### Page 18 of 36

###### For each of these helpers, you may specify a Date or Time object instead of a number as the default value (for

###### example <%= select_year Date.today, prefix: "party" %> instead of the above), and the appropriate

###### date and time parts will be extracted and used.

### 4.2. Selecting Time Zone

###### When you need to ask users what time zone they are in, there is a very convenient time_zone_select

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-

###### time_zone_select) helper to use.

###### Typically, you would have to provide a list of time zone options for users to select from. This can get tedious if

###### not for the list of pre-defined ActiveSupport::TimeZone

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveSupport/TimeZone.html) objects. The time_with_zone

###### helper wraps this and can be used as follows:

###### Output:

```
<select id="party_year" name="party[year]">
<option value="2019"> 2019 </option>
<option value="2020"> 2020 </option>
<option value="2021"> 2021 </option>
<option value="2022"> 2022 </option>
<option value="2023"> 2023 </option>
<option value="2024" selected="selected"> 2024 </option>
<option value="2025"> 2025 </option>
<option value="2026"> 2026 </option>
<option value="2027"> 2027 </option>
<option value="2028"> 2028 </option>
<option value="2029"> 2029 </option>
</select>
```
```
<%= form.time_zone_select :time_zone %>
```

## 5. Collection Related Helpers

###### If you need to generate a set of choices from a collection of arbitrary objects, Rails has collection_select,

###### collection_radio_button, and collection_checkboxes helpers.

###### To see when these helpers are useful, suppose you have a City model and corresponding belongs_to :city

###### association with Person:

###### Assuming we have the following cities stored in the database:

###### We can allow the user to choose from the cities with the following form:

###### The above will generate this HTML

```
<select name="time_zone" id="time_zone">
<option value="International Date Line West">(GMT-12:00) International Date Line
West</option>
<option value="American Samoa">(GMT-11:00) American Samoa</option>
<option value="Midway Island">(GMT-11:00) Midway Island</option>
<option value="Hawaii">(GMT-10:00) Hawaii</option>
<option value="Alaska">(GMT-09:00) Alaska</option>
...
<option value="Samoa">(GMT+13:00) Samoa</option>
<option value="Tokelau Is.">(GMT+13:00) Tokelau Is.</option>
</select>
```
```
class City < ApplicationRecord
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
belongs_to :city
end
```
```
City.order(:name).map { |city| [city.name, city.id] }
# => [["Berlin", 1], ["Chicago", 3], ["Madrid", 2]]
```
```
<%= form_with model: @person do |form| %>
<%= form.select :city_id, City.order(:name).map { |city| [city.name, city.id] } %>
<% end %>
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 19 / 36


##### Page 20 of 36

###### The above example shows how you'd generate the choices manually. However, Rails has helpers that generate

###### choices from a collection without having to explicitly iterate over it. These helpers determine the value and text

###### label of each choice by calling specified methods on each object in the collection.

### 5.1. The collection_select Helper

###### To generate a select box, we can use collection_select

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-

###### collection_select) :

###### The above outputs the same HTML as the manual iteration above:

```
<select name="person[city_id]" id="person_city_id">
<option value="1">Berlin</option>
<option value="3">Chicago</option>
<option value="2">Madrid</option>
</select>
```
###### When rendering a field for a belongs_to association, you must specify the name of the foreign key

###### (city_id in the above example), rather than the name of the association itself.

```
<%= form.collection_select :city_id, City.order(:name), :id, :name %>
```
```
<select name="person[city_id]" id="person_city_id">
<option value="1">Berlin</option>
<option value="3">Chicago</option>
<option value="2">Madrid</option>
</select>
```
###### The order of arguments for collection_select is different from the order for select. With

###### collection_select we specify the value method first (:id in the example above), and the text

###### label method second (:name in the example above). This is opposite of the order used when

###### specifying choices for the select helper, where the text label comes first and the value second

###### (["Berlin", 1] in the previous example).


### 5.2. The collection_radio_buttons Helper

###### To generate a set of radio buttons, we can use collection_radio_buttons

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-

###### collection_radio_buttons) :

###### Output:

### 5.3. The collection_checkboxes Helper

###### To generate a set of check boxes — for example, to support a has_and_belongs_to_many association — we

###### can use collection_checkboxes

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-

###### collection_checkboxes) :

###### Output:

```
<%= form.collection_radio_buttons :city_id, City.order(:name), :id, :name %>
```
```
<input type="radio" value="1" name="person[city_id]" id="person_city_id_1">
<label for="person_city_id_1">Berlin</label>
```
```
<input type="radio" value="3" name="person[city_id]" id="person_city_id_3">
<label for="person_city_id_3">Chicago</label>
```
```
<input type="radio" value="2" name="person[city_id]" id="person_city_id_2">
<label for="person_city_id_2">Madrid</label>
```
```
<%= form.collection_checkboxes :interest_ids, Interest.order(:name), :id, :name %>
```

## 6. Uploading Files

###### A common task with forms is allowing users to upload a file. It could be an avatar image or a CSV file with data

###### to process. File upload fields can be rendered with the file_field

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html#method-i-file_field)

###### helper.

###### The most important thing to remember with file uploads is that the rendered form's enctype attribute must be

###### set to multipart/form-data. This is done automatically if you use a file_field inside a form_with. You

###### can also set the attribute manually:

###### Both of which, output the following HTML form:

```
<input type="checkbox" name="person[interest_id][]" value="3" id="person_interest_id_3">
<label for="person_interest_id_3">Engineering</label>
```
```
<input type="checkbox" name="person[interest_id][]" value="4" id="person_interest_id_4">
<label for="person_interest_id_4">Math</label>
```
```
<input type="checkbox" name="person[interest_id][]" value="1" id="person_interest_id_1">
<label for="person_interest_id_1">Science</label>
```
```
<input type="checkbox" name="person[interest_id][]" value="2" id="person_interest_id_2">
<label for="person_interest_id_2">Technology</label>
```
```
<%= form_with model: @person do |form| %>
<%= form.file_field :csv_file %>
<% end %>
```
```
<%= form_with url: "/uploads", multipart: true do |form| %>
<%= file_field_tag :csv_file %>
<% end %>
```
```
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/people" accept-charset="UTF-8"
method="post">
<!-- ... -->
</form>
```

###### Note that, per form_with conventions, the field names in the two forms above will be different. In the first form,

###### it will be person[csv_file] (accessible via params[:person][:csv_file]), and in the second form it will be

###### just csv_file (accessible via params[:csv_file]).

### 6.1. CSV File Upload Example

###### When using file_field, the object in the params hash is an instance of

```
ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile
```
###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Http/UploadedFile.html). Here is an example of

###### how to save data in an uploaded CSV file to records in your application:

###### If the file is an image that needs to be stored with a model (e.g. user's profile picture), there are a number of

###### tasks to consider, like where to store the file (on Disk, Amazon S3, etc), resizing image files, and generating

###### thumbnails, etc. Active Storage (active_storage_overview.html) is designed to assist with these tasks.

## 7. Customizing Form Builders

###### We call the objects yielded by form_with or fields_for Form Builders. Form builders allow you to generate

###### form elements associated with a model object and are an instance of ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html). This class can be

###### extended to add custom helpers for your application.

###### For example, if you want to display a text_field along with a label across your application, you could add

###### the following helper method to application_helper.rb:

```
require "csv"
```
```
def upload
uploaded_file = params[:csv_file]
if uploaded_file.present?
csv_data = CSV.parse(uploaded_file.read, headers: true)
csv_data.each do |row|
# Process each row of the CSV file
# SomeInvoiceModel.create(amount: row['Amount'], status: row['Status'])
Rails.logger.info row.inspect
#<CSV::Row "id":"po_1KE3FRDSYPMwkcNz9SFKuaYd" "Amount":"96.22" "Created
(UTC)":"2022-01-04 02:59" "Arrival Date (UTC)":"2022-01-05 00:00" "Status":"paid">
end
end
# ...
end
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 23 / 36


##### Page 24 of 36

###### And use it in a form as usual:

###### But you can also create a subclass of ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder, and add the helpers there. After

###### defining this LabellingFormBuilder subclass:

###### The above form can be replaced with:

###### If you reuse this frequently you could define a labeled_form_with helper that automatically applies the

###### builder: LabellingFormBuilder option:

###### The above can be used instead of form_with:

```
module ApplicationHelper
def text_field_with_label(form, attribute)
form.label(attribute) + form.text_field(attribute)
end
end
```
```
<%= form_with model: @person do |form| %>
<%= text_field_with_label form, :first_name %>
<% end %>
```
```
class LabellingFormBuilder < ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder
def text_field(attribute, options = {})
# super will call the original text_field method
label(attribute) + super
end
end
```
```
<%= form_with model: @person, builder: LabellingFormBuilder do |form| %>
<%= form.text_field :first_name %>
<% end %>
```
```
module ApplicationHelper
def labeled_form_with(**options, &block)
options[:builder] = LabellingFormBuilder
form_with(**options, &block)
end
end
```

###### All three cases above (the text_field_with_label helper, the LabellingFormBuilder subclass, and the

###### labeled_form_with helper) will generate the same HTML output:

###### The form builder used also determines what happens when you do:

###### If f is an instance of ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder, then this will render the form partial, setting the

###### partial's object to the form builder. If the form builder is of class LabellingFormBuilder, then the

###### labelling_form partial would be rendered instead.

###### Form builder customizations, such as LabellingFormBuilder, do hide the implementation details (and may

###### seem like an overkill for the simple example above). Choose between different customizations, extending

###### FormBuilder class or creating helpers, based on how frequently your forms use the custom elements.

## 8. Form Input Naming Conventions and params Hash

###### All of the form helpers described above help with generating the HTML for form elements so that the user can

###### enter various types of input. How do you access the user input values in the Controller? The params hash is the

###### answer. You've already seen the params hash in the above example. This section will more explicitly go over

###### naming conventions around how form input is structured in the params hash.

###### The params hash can contain arrays and arrays of hashes. Values can be at the top level of the params hash

###### or nested in another hash. For example, in a standard create action for a Person model, params[:person] will

###### be a hash of all the attributes for the Person object.

###### Note that HTML forms don't have an inherent structure to the user input data, all they generate is name-value

###### string pairs. The arrays and hashes you see in your application are the result of parameter naming conventions

###### that Rails uses.

```
<%= labeled_form_with model: @person do |form| %>
<%= form.text_field :first_name %>
<% end %>
```
```
<form action="/people" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
<!-- ... -->
<label for="person_first_name">First name</label>
<input type="text" name="person[first_name]" id="person_first_name">
</form>
```
```
<%= render partial: f %>
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 25 / 36


##### Page 26 of 36

### 8.1. Basic Structure

###### The two basic structures for user input form data are arrays and hashes.

###### Hashes mirror the syntax used for accessing the value in params. For example, if a form contains:

###### the params hash will contain

###### and params[:person][:name] will retrieve the submitted value in the controller.

###### Hashes can be nested as many levels as required, for example:

###### The above will result in the params hash being

###### The other structure is an Array. Normally Rails ignores duplicate parameter names, but if the parameter name

###### ends with an empty set of square brackets [] then the parameters will be accumulated in an Array.

###### For example, if you want users to be able to input multiple phone numbers, you could place this in the form:

###### This would result in params[:person][:phone_number] being an array containing the submitted phone

###### numbers:

###### The fields in the params hash need to be permitted in the controller.

```
<input id="person_name" name="person[name]" type="text" value="Henry"/>
```
```
{ "person" => { "name" => "Henry" } }
```
```
<input id="person_address_city" name="person[address][city]" type="text" value="New
York"/>
```
```
{ "person" => { "address" => { "city" => "New York" } } }
```
```
<input name="person[phone_number][]" type="text"/>
<input name="person[phone_number][]" type="text"/>
<input name="person[phone_number][]" type="text"/>
```

### 8.2. Combining Arrays and Hashes

###### You can mix and match these two concepts. One element of a hash might be an array as in the previous

###### example params[:person] hash has a key called [:phone_number] whose value is an array.

###### You also can have an array of hashes. For example, you can create any number of addresses by repeating the

###### following form fragment:

###### This would result in params[:person][:addresses] being an array of hashes. Each hash in the array will have

###### the keys line1, line2, and city, something like this:

###### It's important to note that while hashes can be nested arbitrarily, only one level of "arrayness" is allowed. Arrays

###### can usually be replaced by hashes. For example, instead of an array of model objects, you can have a hash of

###### model objects keyed by their id or similar.

```
{ "person" => { "phone_number" => ["555-0123", "555-0124", "555-0125"] } }
```
```
<input name="person[addresses][][line1]" type="text"/>
<input name="person[addresses][][line2]" type="text"/>
<input name="person[addresses][][city]" type="text"/>
<input name="person[addresses][][line1]" type="text"/>
<input name="person[addresses][][line2]" type="text"/>
<input name="person[addresses][][city]" type="text"/>
```
```
{ "person" =>
{ "addresses" => [
{ "line1" => "1000 Fifth Avenue",
"line2" => "",
"city" => "New York"
},
{ "line1" => "Calle de Ruiz de Alarcón",
"line2" => "",
"city" => "Madrid"
}
]
}
}
```
###### Array parameters do not play well with the checkbox helper. According to the HTML specification

###### unchecked checkboxes submit no value. However it is often convenient for a checkbox to always

###### submit a value. The checkbox helper fakes this by creating an auxiliary hidden input with the same

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 27 / 36


##### Page 28 of 36

### 8.3. Hashes with an Index

###### Let's say you want to render a form with a set of fields for each of a person's addresses. The fields_for

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-fields_for)

###### helper with its :index option can assist:

###### Assuming the person has two addresses with IDs 23 and 45, the above form would render this output:

###### Which will result in a params hash that looks like:

###### name. If the checkbox is unchecked only the hidden input is submitted. If it is checked then both are

###### submitted but the value submitted by the checkbox takes precedence. There is a include_hidden

###### option that can be set to false if you want to omit this hidden field. By default, this option is true.

```
<%= form_with model: @person do |person_form| %>
<%= person_form.text_field :name %>
<% @person.addresses.each do |address| %>
<%= person_form.fields_for address, index: address.id do |address_form| %>
<%= address_form.text_field :city %>
<% end %>
<% end %>
<% end %>
```
```
<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/people/1" method="post">
<input name="_method" type="hidden" value="patch" />
<input id="person_name" name="person[name]" type="text" />
<input id="person_address_23_city" name="person[address][23][city]" type="text" />
<input id="person_address_45_city" name="person[address][45][city]" type="text" />
</form>
```

###### All of the form inputs map to the "person" hash because we called fields_for on the person_form form

###### builder. Also, by specifying index: address.id, we rendered the name attribute of each city input as

###### person[address][#{address.id}][city] instead of person[address][city]. This way you can tell which

###### Address records should be modified when processing the params hash.

###### You can find more details about fields_for index option in the API docs

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-fields_for).

## 9. Building Complex Forms

###### As your application grows, you may need to create more complex forms, beyond editing a single object. For

###### example, when creating a Person you can allow the user to create multiple Address records (home, work,

###### etc.) within the same form. When editing a Person record later, the user should be able to add, remove, or

###### update addresses as well.

### 9.1. Configuring the Model for Nested Attributes

###### For editing an associated record for a given model (Person in this case), Active Record provides model level

###### support via the accepts_nested_attributes_for

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods.html#method-i-

###### accepts_nested_attributes_for) method:

```
{
"person" => {
"name" => "Bob",
"address" => {
"23" => {
"city" => "Paris"
},
"45" => {
"city" => "London"
}
}
}
}
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html 29 / 36


##### Page 30 of 36

###### This creates an addresses_attributes= method on Person that allows you to create, update, and destroy

###### addresses.

### 9.2. Nested Forms in the View

###### The following form allows a user to create a Person and its associated addresses.

###### When an association accepts nested attributes, fields_for renders its block once for every element of the

###### association. In particular, if a person has no addresses, it renders nothing.

###### A common pattern is for the controller to build one or more empty children so that at least one set of fields is

###### shown to the user. The example below would result in 2 sets of address fields being rendered on the new

###### person form.

###### For example, the above form_with with this change:

```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
has_many :addresses, inverse_of: :person
accepts_nested_attributes_for :addresses
end
```
```
class Address < ApplicationRecord
belongs_to :person
end
```
```
<%= form_with model: @person do |form| %>
Addresses:
<ul>
<%= form.fields_for :addresses do |addresses_form| %>
<li>
<%= addresses_form.label :kind %>
<%= addresses_form.text_field :kind %>
```
```
<%= addresses_form.label :street %>
<%= addresses_form.text_field :street %>
...
</li>
<% end %>
</ul>
<% end %>
```

###### Will output the following HTML

###### The fields_for yields a form builder. The parameter names will be what accepts_nested_attributes_for

###### expects. For example, when creating a person with 2 addresses, the submitted parameters in params would

###### look like this:

```
def new
@person = Person.new
2 .times { @person.addresses.build }
end
```
```
<form action="/people" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post"><input type="hidden"

##### Page 32 of 36

###### The actual value of the keys in the :addresses_attributes hash is not important. But they need to be strings

###### of integers and different for each address.

###### If the associated object is already saved, fields_for autogenerates a hidden input with the id of the saved

###### record. You can disable this by passing include_id: false to fields_for.

### 9.3. Permitting Parameters in the Controller

###### As usual you need to declare the permitted parameters (action_controller_overview.html#strong-parameters)

###### in the controller before you pass them to the model:

```
{
"person" => {
"name" => "John Doe",
"addresses_attributes" => {
"0" => {
"kind" => "Home",
"street" => "221b Baker Street"
},
"1" => {
"kind" => "Office",
"street" => "31 Spooner Street"
}
}
}
}
```
```
{
"person" => {
"name" => "John Doe",
"addresses_attributes" => {
"0" => {
"id" => 1 ,
"kind" => "Home",
"street" => "221b Baker Street"
},
"1" => {
"id" => "2",
"kind" => "Office",
"street" => "31 Spooner Street"
}
}
}
}
```

### 9.4. Removing Associated Objects

###### You can allow users to delete associated objects by passing allow_destroy: true to

```
accepts_nested_attributes_for
```
###### If the hash of attributes for an object contains the key _destroy with a value that evaluates to true (e.g. 1 ,

###### '1', true, or 'true') then the object will be destroyed. This form allows users to remove addresses:

###### The HTML for the _destroy field:

```
def create
@person = Person.new(person_params)
# ...
end
```
```
private
def person_params
params.expect(person: [ :name, addresses_attributes: [[ :id, :kind, :street ]] ])
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
has_many :addresses
accepts_nested_attributes_for :addresses, allow_destroy: true
end
```
```
<%= form_with model: @person do |form| %>
Addresses:
<ul>
<%= form.fields_for :addresses do |addresses_form| %>
<li>
<%= addresses_form.checkbox :_destroy %>
<%= addresses_form.label :kind %>
<%= addresses_form.text_field :kind %>
...
</li>
<% end %>
</ul>
<% end %>
```

###### You also need to update the permitted params in your controller to include the _destroy field:

### 9.5. Preventing Empty Records

###### It is often useful to ignore sets of fields that the user has not filled in. You can control this by passing a

###### :reject_if proc to accepts_nested_attributes_for. This proc will be called with each hash of attributes

###### submitted by the form. If the proc returns true then Active Record will not build an associated object for that

###### hash. The example below only tries to build an address if the kind attribute is set.

###### As a convenience you can instead pass the symbol :all_blank which will create a proc that will reject records

###### where all the attributes are blank excluding any value for _destroy.

## 10. Forms to External Resources

###### Rails form helpers can be used to build a form for posting data to an external resource. If the external API

###### expects an authenticity_token for the resource, this can be passed as an authenticity_token:

###### 'your_external_token' parameter to form_with:

```
<input type="checkbox" value="1" name="person[addresses_attributes][0][_destroy]"
id="person_addresses_attributes_0__destroy">
```
```
def person_params
params.require(:person).
permit(:name, addresses_attributes: [:id, :kind, :street, :_destroy])
end
```
```
class Person < ApplicationRecord
has_many :addresses
accepts_nested_attributes_for :addresses, reject_if: lambda { |attributes|
attributes["kind"].blank? }
end
```
```
<%= form_with url: 'http://farfar.away/form', authenticity_token: 'external_token' do %>
Form contents
<% end %>
```

###### At other times, the fields that can be used in the form are limited by an external API and it may be undesirable to

###### generate an authenticity_token. To not send a token, you can pass false to the :authenticity_token

###### option:

## 11. Using Tag Helpers without a Form Builder

###### In case you need to render form fields outside of the context of a form builder, Rails provides tag helpers for

###### common form elements. For example, checkbox_tag

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper.html#method-i-

###### checkbox_tag) :

###### Output:

###### Generally, these helpers have the same name as their form builder counterparts plus a _tag suffix. For a

###### complete list, see the FormTagHelper API documentation

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper.html).

## 12. Using form_tag and form_for

###### Before form_with was introduced in Rails 5.1 its functionality was split between form_tag

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper.html#method-i-form_tag)

###### and form_for (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-

###### form_for). Both are now discouraged in favor of form_with, but you can still find them being used in some

###### codebases.

```
<%= form_with url: 'http://farfar.away/form', authenticity_token: false do %>
Form contents
<% end %>
```
```
<%= checkbox_tag "accept" %>
```
```
<input type="checkbox" name="accept" id="accept" value="1" />
```
