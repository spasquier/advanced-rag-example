# Action View Overview

##### After reading this guide, you will know:

##### What Action View is and how to use it with Rails.

##### How best to use templates, partials, and layouts.

##### How to use localized views.

## 1. What is Action View?

##### Action View is the V in MVC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).

##### Action Controller (action_controller_overview.html) and Action View work together to handle web requests.

##### Action Controller is concerned with communicating with the model layer (of MVC and retrieving data. Action

##### View is then responsible for rendering a response body to the web request using that data.

##### By default, Action View templates (also referred to simply as "views") are written using Embedded Ruby ERB,

##### which allows using Ruby code within HTML documents.

##### Action View provides many helper methods for dynamically generating HTML tags for forms, dates, and strings.

##### It's also possible to add custom helpers to your application as needed.

##### Action View can make use of Active Model features like to_param

##### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Conversion.html#method-i-to_param)

##### and to_partial_path

##### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveModel/Conversion.html#method-i-

##### to_partial_path) to simplify code. That doesn't mean Action View depends on Active Model. Action

##### View is an independent package that can be used with any Ruby library.

## 2. Using Action View with Rails

##### Action View templates (aka "views") are stored in subdirectories in the app/views directory. There is a

##### subdirectory matching the name of each controller. The view files inside that subdirectory are used to render

##### specific views as a response to controller actions.

##### For example, when you use scaffolding to generate an article resource, Rails generates the following files in

##### app/views/articles:

##### The file names follow a Rails naming convention. They share their name with the associated controller action.

##### For example the index.html.erb, edit.html.erb, etc.

##### By following this naming convention, Rails will automatically find and render the matching view at the end of a

##### controller action, without you having to specify it. For example, the index action in the

##### articles_controller.rb will automatically render the index.html.erb view inside the

##### app/views/articles/ directory. The name and the location of the file are both important.

##### The final HTML returned to the client is composed of a combination of the .html.erb ERB file, a layout

##### template that wraps it, and all the partials that the ERB file may reference. In the rest of this guide, you will find

##### more details about each of the three components: Templates, Partials, Layouts.

## 3. Templates

##### Action View templates can be written in different formats. If the template file has a .erb extension, it uses

##### embedded Ruby to build an HTML response. If the template has a .jbuilder extension, it uses the Jbuilder

##### (https://github.com/rails/jbuilder) gem to build a JSON response. And a template with a .builder extension

##### uses the Builder::XmlMarkup (https://github.com/rails/builder) library to build an XML response.

```
$ bin/rails generate scaffold article
[...]
invoke scaffold_controller
create app/controllers/articles_controller.rb
invoke erb
create app/views/articles
create app/views/articles/index.html.erb
create app/views/articles/edit.html.erb
create app/views/articles/show.html.erb
create app/views/articles/new.html.erb
create app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
[...]
```

##### Rails uses the file extension to distinguish among multiple template systems. For example, an HTML file using

##### the ERB template system will have .html.erb as a file extension, and a JSON file using the Jbuilder template

##### system will have the .json.jbuilder file extension. Other libraries may add other template types and file

##### extensions as well.

### 3.1. ERB

##### An ERB template is a way to sprinkle Ruby code within static HTML using special ERB tags like <% %> and <%=

##### %>.

##### When Rails processes the ERB view templates ending with .html.erb, it evaluates the embedded Ruby code

##### and replaces the ERB tags with the dynamic output. That dynamic content is combined with the static HTML

##### markup to form the final HTML response.

##### Within an ERB template, Ruby code can be included using both <% %> and <%=

##### %> tags. The <% %> tag (without the =) is used when you want to execute Ruby code but not directly output

##### the result, such as conditions or loops. The tag <%= %> is used for Ruby code that generates an output and you

##### want that output rendered within the template, such as a model attribute like person.name in this example:

##### The loop is set up using regular embedding tags (<% %>) and the name is inserted using the output embedding

##### tags (<%= %>).

##### Note that functions such as print and puts won't be rendered to the view with ERB templates. So something

##### like this would not work:

##### The above example shows that comments can be added in ERB within <%# %> tag.

##### To suppress leading and trailing whitespaces, you can use <%- -%> interchangeably with <% and %>.

### 3.2. Jbuilder

##### Jbuilder is a gem that's maintained by the Rails team and included in the default Rails Gemfile. It is used to

##### build JSON responses using templates.

##### If you don't have it, you can add the following to your Gemfile:

```
<h1>Names</h1>
<% @people.each do |person| %>
Name: <%= person.name %><br>
<% end %>
```
###### <%# WRONG %>

```
Hi, Mr. <% puts "Frodo" %>
```

##### A Jbuilder object named json is automatically made available to templates with a .jbuilder extension.

##### Here is a basic example:

##### would produce:

##### See the Jbuilder documentation (https://github.com/rails/jbuilder#jbuilder) for more examples.

### 3.3. Builder

##### Builder templates are a more programmatic alternative to ERB. It's similar to JBuilder but is used to generate

##### XML, instead of JSON.

##### An XmlMarkup object named xml is automatically made available to templates with a .builder extension.

##### Here is a basic examples:

##### which would produce:

```
gem "jbuilder"
```
```
json.name("Alex")
json.email("alex@example.com")
```
###### {

```
"name": "Alex",
"email": "alex@example.com"
}
```
```
xml.em("emphasized")
xml.em { xml.b("emph & bold") }
xml.a("A Link", "href" => "https://rubyonrails.org")
xml.target("name" => "compile", "option" => "fast")
```
```
<em>emphasized</em>
<em><b>emph &amp; bold</b></em>
<a href="https://rubyonrails.org">A link</a>
<target option="fast" name="compile" />
```

##### Any method with a block will be treated as an XML markup tag with nested markup in the block. For example,

##### the following:

##### would produce something like:

##### See Builder documentation (https://github.com/rails/builder) for more examples.

### 3.4. Template Compilation

##### By default, Rails will compile each template to a method to render it. In the development environment, when you

##### alter a template, Rails will check the file's modification time and recompile it.

##### There is also Fragment Caching for when different parts of the page need to be cached and expired separately.

##### Learn more about it in the caching guide (caching_with_rails.html#fragment-caching).

## 4. Partials

##### Partial templates - usually just called "partials" - are a way of breaking up the view templates into smaller

##### reusable chunks. With partials, you can extract a piece of code from your main template to a separate smaller

##### file, and render that file in the main template. You can also pass data to the partial files from the main template.

##### Let's see this in action with some examples:

### 4.1. Rendering Partials

##### To render a partial as part of a view, you use the render

##### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Helpers/RenderingHelper.html#method-i-render)

##### method within the view:

```
xml.div {
xml.h1(@person.name)
xml.p(@person.bio)
}
```
```
<div>
<h1>David Heinemeier Hansson</h1>
<p>A product of Danish Design during the Winter of '79...</p>
</div>
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html 5 / 19


#### Page 6 of 19

##### This will look for a file named _product.html.erb in the same folder to render within that view. Partial file

##### names start with leading underscore character by convention. The file name distinguishes partials from regular

##### views. However, no underscore is used when referring to partials for rendering within a view. This is true even

##### when you reference a partial from another directory:

##### That code will look for and display a partial file named _product.html.erb in app/views/application/.

### 4.2. Using Partials to Simplify Views

##### One way to use partials is to treat them as the equivalent of methods. A way to move details out of a view so

##### that you can grasp what's going on more easily. For example, you might have a view that looks like this:

##### Here, the _ad_banner.html.erb and _footer.html.erb partials could contain content that is shared among

##### many pages in your application. You don't need to see the details of these sections when you're focused on a

##### Products' page.

##### The above example also uses the _product.html.erb partial. This partial contains details for rendering an

##### individual product and is used to render each product in the collection @products.

### 4.3. Passing Data to Partials with locals Option

##### When rendering a partial, you can pass data to the partial from the rendering view. You use the locals:

##### options hash for this. Each key in the locals: option is available as a partial-local variable:

```
<%= render "product" %>
```
```
<%= render "application/product" %>
```
```
<%= render "application/ad_banner" %>
```
```
<h1>Products</h1>
```
```
<p>Here are a few of our fine products:</p>
<% @products.each do |product| %>
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { product: product } %>
<% end %>
```
```
<%= render "application/footer" %>
```

##### A "partial-local variable" is a variable that is local to a given partial and only available from within that partial. In

##### the above example, my_product is a partial-local variable. It was assigned the value of @product when passed

##### to the partial from the original view.

##### Note that typically we'd simply call this local variable product. We are using my_product to distinguish it from

##### the instance variable name and template name in this example.

##### Since locals is a hash, you can pass in multiple variables as needed, like locals: { my_product:

##### @product, my_reviews: @reviews }.

##### However, if a template refers to a variable that isn't passed into the view as part of the locals: option, the

##### template will raise an ActionView::Template::Error:

### 4.4. Using local_assigns

##### Each partial has a method called local_assigns

##### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/Template.html#method-i-local_assigns) available.

##### You can use this method to access keys passed via the locals: option. If a partial was not rendered with

##### :some_key set, the value of local_assigns[:some_key] will be nil within the partial.

##### For example, product_reviews is nil in the below example since only product is set in locals::

```
<%# app/views/products/show.html.erb %>
```
```
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { my_product: @product } %>
```
```
<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>
```
```
<%= tag.div id: dom_id(my_product) do %>
<h1><%= my_product.name %></h1>
<% end %>
```
```
<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>
```
```
<%= tag.div id: dom_id(my_product) do %>
<h1><%= my_product.name %></h1>
```
```
<%# => raises ActionView::Template::Error for `product_reviews` %>
<% product_reviews.each do |review| %>
<%# ... %>
<% end %>
<% end %>
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html 7 / 19


#### Page 8 of 19

##### One use case for local_assigns is optionally passing in a local variable and then conditionally performing an

##### action in the partial based on whether the local variable is set. For example:

##### Another example from Active Storage's _blob.html.erb. This one sets the size based on whether

##### in_gallery local variable is set when rendering the partial that contains this line:

### 4.5. render without partial and locals Options

##### In the above examples, render takes 2 options: partial and locals. But if these are the only options you

##### need to use, you can skip the keys, partial and locals, and specify the values only.

##### For example, instead of:

##### You can write:

##### You can also use this shorthand based on conventions:

```
<%# app/views/products/show.html.erb %>
```
```
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { product: @product } %>
```
```
<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>
```
```
<% local_assigns[:product] # => "#<Product:0x0000000109ec5d10>" %>
<% local_assigns[:product_reviews] # => nil %>
```
```
<% if local_assigns[:redirect] %>
<%= form.hidden_field :redirect, value: true %>
<% end %>
```
```
<%= image_tag blob.representation(resize_to_limit: local_assigns[:in_gallery]? [ 800 ,
600 ] : [ 1024 , 768 ]) %>
```
```
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { product: @product } %>
```
```
<%= render "product", product: @product %>
```

##### This will look for a partial named _product.html.erb in app/views/products/, as well as pass a local named

##### product set to the value @product.

### 4.6. The as and object Options

##### By default, objects passed to the template are in a local variable with the same name as the template. So, given:

##### within the _product.html.erb partial you'll get @product instance variable in the local variable product, as

##### if you had written:

##### The object option can be used to specify a different name. This is useful when the template's object is

##### elsewhere (e.g. in a different instance variable or in a local variable).

##### For example, instead of:

##### you can write:

##### This assigns the instance variable @item to a partial local variable named product. What if you wanted to

##### change the local variable name from the default product to something else? You can use the :as option for

##### that.

##### With the as option, you can specify a different name for the local variable like this:

##### This is equivalent to

```
<%= render @product %>
```
```
<%= render @product %>
```
```
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { product: @product } %>
```
```
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { product: @item } %>
```
```
<%= render partial: "product", object: @item %>
```
```
<%= render partial: "product", object: @item, as: "item" %>
```

#### Page 10 of 19

### 4.7. Rendering Collections

##### It's common for a view to iterate over a collection, such as @products, and render a partial template for each

##### object in the collection. This pattern has been implemented as a single method that accepts an array and

##### renders a partial for each one of the elements in the array.

##### So this example for rendering all the products:

##### can be rewritten in a single line:

##### When a partial is called with a collection, the individual instances of the partial have access to the member of

##### the collection being rendered via a variable named after the partial. In this case, since the partial is

##### _product.html.erb, you can use product to refer to the collection member that is being rendered.

##### You can also use the following conventions based shorthand syntax for rendering collections.

##### The above assumes that @products is a collection of Product instances. Rails uses naming conventions to

##### determine the name of the partial to use by looking at the model name in the collection, Product in this case. In

##### fact, you can even render a collection made up of instances of different models using this shorthand, and Rails

##### will choose the proper partial for each member of the collection.

### 4.8. Spacer Templates

##### You can also specify a second partial to be rendered between instances of the main partial by using the

##### :spacer_template option:

```
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { item: @item } %>
```
```
<% @products.each do |product| %>
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { product: product } %>
<% end %>
```
```
<%= render partial: "product", collection: @products %>
```
```
<%= render @products %>
```
```
<%= render partial: @products, spacer_template: "product_ruler" %>
```

##### Rails will render the _product_ruler.html.erb partial (with no data passed to it) between each pair of

##### _product.html.erb partials.

### 4.9. Counter Variables

##### Rails also makes a counter variable available within a partial called by the collection. The variable is named after

##### the title of the partial followed by _counter. For example, when rendering a collection @products the partial

##### _product.html.erb can access the variable product_counter. The variable indexes the number of times the

##### partial has been rendered within the enclosing view, starting with a value of 0 on the first render.

##### This also works when the local variable name is changed using the as: option. So if you did as: :item, the

##### counter variable would be item_counter.

##### Note: The following two sections, Strict Locals and Local Assigns with Pattern Matching are more advanced

##### features of using partials, included here for completeness.

### 4.10. local_assigns with Pattern Matching

##### Since local_assigns is a Hash, it's compatible with Ruby 3.1's pattern matching assignment operator

##### (https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/syntax/pattern_matching_rdoc.html) :

##### When keys other than :product are assigned into a partial-local Hash variable, they can be splatted into

##### helper method calls:

```
<%# index.html.erb %>
<%= render partial: "product", collection: @products %>
```
```
<%# _product.html.erb %>
<%= product_counter %> # 0 for the first product, 1 for the second product...
```
##### When rendering collections with instances of different models, the counter variable increments for

##### each partial, regardless of the class of the model being rendered.

```
local_assigns => { product:, **options }
product # => "#<Product:0x0000000109ec5d10>"
options # => {}
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html 11 / 19


#### Page 12 of 19

##### Pattern matching assignment also supports variable renaming:

##### You can also conditionally read a variable, then fall back to a default value when the key isn't part of the

##### locals: options, using fetch:

##### Combining Ruby 3.1's pattern matching assignment with calls to Hash#with_defaults

##### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/Hash.html#method-i-with_defaults) enables compact partial-local

##### default variable assignments:

```
<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>
```
```
<% local_assigns => { product:, **options } %>
```
```
<%= tag.div id: dom_id(product), **options do %>
<h1><%= product.name %></h1>
<% end %>
```
```
<%# app/views/products/show.html.erb %>
```
```
<%= render "products/product", product: @product, class: "card" %>
<%# => <div id="product_1" class="card">
# <h1>A widget</h1>
# </div>
%>
```
```
local_assigns => { product: record }
product # => "#<Product:0x0000000109ec5d10>"
record # => "#<Product:0x0000000109ec5d10>"
product == record # => true
```
```
<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>
```
```
<% local_assigns.fetch(:related_products, []).each do |related_product| %>
<%# ... %>
<% end %>
```

### 4.11. Strict Locals

##### Action View partials are compiled into regular Ruby methods under the hood. Because it is impossible in Ruby to

##### dynamically create local variables, every single combination of locals passed to a partial requires compiling

##### another version:

##### The above snippet will cause the partial to be compiled twice, taking more time and using more memory.

##### When the number of combinations is small, it's not really a problem, but if it's large it can waste a sizeable

##### amount of memory and take a long time to compile. To counter act this you can use strict locals to define the

##### compiled partial signature, and ensure only a single version of the partial is compiled:

```
<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>
```
```
<% local_assigns.with_defaults(related_products: []) => { product:, related_products: }
%>
```
```
<%= tag.div id: dom_id(product) do %>
<h1><%= product.name %></h1>
```
```
<% related_products.each do |related_product| %>
<%# ... %>
<% end %>
<% end %>
```
```
<%# app/views/articles/show.html.erb %>
<%= render partial: "article", layout: "box", locals: { article: @article } %>
<%= render partial: "article", layout: "box", locals: { article: @article, theme: "dark"
} %>
```
```
def _render_template_2323231_article_show(buffer, local_assigns, article:)
# ...
end
```
```
def _render_template_3243454_article_show(buffer, local_assigns, article:, theme:)
# ...
end
```
```
<%# locals: (article:, theme: "light") -%>
...
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html 13 / 19


#### Page 14 of 19

##### You can enforce how many and which locals a template accepts, set default values, and more with a locals:

##### signature, using the same syntax as Ruby method signatures.

##### Here are some examples of the locals: signature:

##### The above makes message a required local variable. Rendering the partial without a :message local variable

##### argument will raise an exception:

##### If a default value is set then it can be used if message is not passed in locals::

##### Rendering the partial without a :message local variable uses the default value set in the locals: signature:

##### Rendering the partial with local variables not specified in the local: signature will also raise an exception:

##### You can allow optional local variable arguments with the double splat ** operator:

```
<%# app/views/messages/_message.html.erb %>
```
```
<%# locals: (message:) -%>
<%= message %>
```
```
render "messages/message"
# => ActionView::Template::Error: missing local: :message for
app/views/messages/_message.html.erb
```
```
<%# app/views/messages/_message.html.erb %>
```
```
<%# locals: (message: "Hello, world!") -%>
<%= message %>
```
```
render "messages/message"
# => "Hello, world!"
```
```
render "messages/message", unknown_local: "will raise"
# => ActionView::Template::Error: unknown local: :unknown_local for
app/views/messages/_message.html.erb
```

##### Or you can disable locals entirely by setting the locals: to empty ():

##### Rendering the partial with any local variable arguments will raise an exception:

##### Action View will process the locals: signature in any templating engine that supports #-prefixed comments,

##### and will read the signature from any line in the partial.

##### The local_assigns method does not contain default values specified in the local: signature. To access a

##### local variable with a default value that is named the same as a reserved Ruby keyword, like class or if, the

##### values can be accessed through binding.local_variable_get:

## 5. Layouts

##### Layouts can be used to render a common view template around the results of Rails controller actions. A Rails

##### application can have multiple layouts that pages can be rendered within.

```
<%# app/views/messages/_message.html.erb %>
```
```
<%# locals: (message: "Hello, world!", **attributes) -%>
<%= tag.p(message, **attributes) %>
```
```
<%# app/views/messages/_message.html.erb %>
```
```
<%# locals: () %>
```
```
render "messages/message", unknown_local: "will raise"
# => ActionView::Template::Error: no locals accepted for
app/views/messages/_message.html.erb
```
##### Only keyword arguments are supported. Defining positional or block arguments will raise an Action

##### View Error at render-time.

```
<%# locals: (class: "message") %>
<div class="<%= binding.local_variable_get(:class) %>">...</div>
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html 15 / 19


#### Page 16 of 19

##### For example, an application might have one layout for a logged in user and another for the marketing part of the

##### site. The logged in user layout might include top-level navigation that should be present across many controller

##### actions. The sales layout for a SaaS app might include top-level navigation for things like "Pricing" and "Contact

##### Us" pages. Different layouts can have a different header and footer content.

##### To find the layout for the current controller action, Rails first looks for a file in app/views/layouts with the

##### same base name as the controller. For example, rendering actions from the ProductsController class will use

##### app/views/layouts/products.html.erb.

##### Rails will use app/views/layouts/application.html.erb if a controller-specific layout does not exist.

##### Here is an example of a simple layout in application.html.erb file:

##### In the above example layout, view content will be rendered in place of <%=

##### yield %>, and surrounded by the same <head>, <nav>, and <footer> content.

##### Rails provides more ways to assign specific layouts to individual controllers and actions. You can learn more

##### about layouts in general in the Layouts and Rendering in Rails (layouts_and_rendering.html) guide.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title><%= "Your Rails App" %></title>
<%= csrf_meta_tags %>
<%= csp_meta_tag %>
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
<%= javascript_importmap_tags %>
</head>
<body>
```
```
<nav>
<ul>
<li><%= link_to "Home", root_path %></li>
<li><%= link_to "Products", products_path %></li>
<!-- Additional navigation links here -->
</ul>
</nav>
```
```
<%= yield %>
```
```
<footer>
<p>&copy; <%= Date.current.year %> Your Company</p>
</footer>
```

### 5.1. Partial Layouts

##### Partials can have their own layouts applied to them. These layouts are different from those applied to a controller

##### action, but they work in a similar fashion.

##### Let's say you're displaying an article on a page which should be wrapped in a div for display purposes. First,

##### you'll create a new Article:

##### In the show template, you'll render the _article partial wrapped in the box layout:

##### The box layout simply wraps the _article partial in a div:

##### Note that the partial layout has access to the local article variable that was passed into the render call,

##### although it is not being used within _box.html.erb in this case.

##### Unlike application-wide layouts, partial layouts still have the underscore prefix in their name.

##### You can also render a block of code within a partial layout instead of calling yield. For example, if you didn't

##### have the _article partial, you could do this instead:

##### Assuming you use the same _box partial from above, this would produce the same output as the previous

##### example.

```
Article.create(body: "Partial Layouts are cool!")
```
```
<%# app/views/articles/show.html.erb %>
<%= render partial: 'article', layout: 'box', locals: { article: @article } %>
```
```
<%# app/views/articles/_box.html.erb %>
<div class="box">
<%= yield %>
</div>
```
```
<%# app/views/articles/show.html.erb %>
<%= render(layout: 'box', locals: { article: @article }) do %>
<div>
<p><%= article.body %></p>
</div>
<% end %>
```

#### Page 18 of 19

### 5.2. Collection with Partial Layouts

##### When rendering collections it is also possible to use the :layout option:

##### The layout will be rendered together with the partial for each item in the collection. The current object and

##### object_counter variables, article and article_counter in the above example, will be available in the layout

##### as well, the same way they are within the partial.

## 6. Helpers

##### Rails provides many helper methods to use with Action View. These include methods for:

##### Formatting dates, strings and numbers

##### Creating HTML links to images, videos, stylesheets, etc...

##### Sanitizing content

##### Creating forms

##### Localizing content

##### You can learn more about helpers in the Action View Helpers Guide (action_view_helpers.html) and the Action

##### View Form Helpers Guide (form_helpers.html).

## 7. Localized Views

##### Action View has the ability to render different templates depending on the current locale.

##### For example, suppose you have an ArticlesController with a show action. By default, calling this action will

##### render app/views/articles/show.html.erb. But if you set I18n.locale = :de, then Action View will try to

##### render the template app/views/articles/show.de.html.erb first. If the localized template isn't present, the

##### undecorated version will be used. This means you're not required to provide localized views for all cases, but

##### they will be preferred and used if available.

##### You can use the same technique to localize the rescue files in your public directory. For example, setting

##### I18n.locale = :de and creating public/500.de.html and public/404.de.html would allow you to have

##### localized rescue pages.

##### See the Rails Internationalization I18n) API documentation (i18n.html) for more details.

```
<%= render partial: "article", collection: @articles, layout: "special_layout" %>
```
