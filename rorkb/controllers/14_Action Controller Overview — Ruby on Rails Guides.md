# Action Controller Overview

###### In this guide, you will learn how controllers work and how they fit into the request cycle in your application.

###### After reading this guide, you will know how to:

###### Follow the flow of a request through a controller.

###### Access parameters passed to your controller.

###### Use Strong Parameters and permit values.

###### Store data in the cookie, the session, and the flash.

###### Work with action callbacks to execute code during request processing.

###### Use the Request and Response Objects.

## 1. Introduction

###### Action Controller is the C in the Model View Controller ( MVC

###### (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) ) pattern. After the router

###### (routing.html) has matched a controller to an incoming request, the controller is responsible for processing the

###### request and generating the appropriate output.

###### For most conventional RESTful (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) applications, the

###### controller will receive the request, fetch or save data from a model, and use a view to create HTML output.

###### You can imagine that a controller sits between models and views. The controller makes model data available to the

###### view, so that the view can display that data to the user. The controller also receives user input from the view and

###### saves or updates model data accordingly.

## 2. Creating a Controller

###### A controller is a Ruby class which inherits from ApplicationController and has methods just like any other

###### class. Once an incoming request is matched to a controller by the router, Rails creates an instance of that controller

###### class and calls the method with the same name as the action.

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html 1 / 28


##### Page 2 of 28

###### Given the above ClientsController, if a user goes to /clients/new in your application to add a new client,

###### Rails will create an instance of ClientsController and call its new method. If the new method is empty, Rails will

###### automatically render the new.html.erb view by default.

###### In the new method, the controller would typically create an instance of the Client model, and make it available as

###### an instance variable called @client in the view:

### 2.1. Controller Naming Convention

###### Rails favors making the resource in the controller's name plural. For example, ClientsController is preferred

###### over ClientController and SiteAdminsController over SiteAdminController or SitesAdminsController.

###### However, the plural names are not strictly required (e.g. ApplicationController).

###### Following this naming convention will allow you to use the default route generators (routing.html#crud-verbs-

###### and-actions) (e.g. resources) without needing to qualify each with options such as :controller

###### (routing.html#specifying-a-controller-to-use). The convention also makes named route helpers consistent

###### throughout your application.

###### The controller naming convention is different from models. While plural names are preferred for controller names,

###### the singular form is preferred for model names (active_record_basics.html#naming-conventions) (e.g. Account

###### vs. Accounts).

###### Controller actions should be public, as only public methods are callable as actions. It is also best practice to

###### lower the visibility of helper methods (with private or protected) which are not intended to be actions.

```
class ClientsController < ApplicationController
def new
end
end
```
###### The new method is an instance method here, called on an instance of ClientsController. This

###### should not be confused with the new class method (i.e., ClientsController.new).

```
def new
@client = Client.new
end
```
###### All controllers inherit from ApplicationController, which in turn inherits from

###### ActionController::Base (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Base.html).

###### For API only (https://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html) applications ApplicationController

###### inherits from ActionController::API

###### (https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/API.html).


## 3. Parameters

###### Data sent by the incoming request is available in your controller in the params

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/StrongParameters.html#method-i-params) hash.

###### There are two types of parameter data:

###### Query string parameters which are sent as part of the URL (for example, after the? in

###### http://example.com/accounts?filter=free).

###### POST parameters which are submitted from an HTML form.

###### Rails does not make a distinction between query string parameters and POST parameters; both are available in the

###### params hash in your controller. For example:

###### Some method names are reserved by Action Controller. Accidentally redefining them could result in

###### SystemStackError. If you limit your controllers to only RESTful Resource Routing

###### (routing.html#resource-routing-the-rails-default) actions you should not need to worry about this.

###### If you must use a reserved method as an action name, one workaround is to use a custom route to map

###### the reserved method name to your non-reserved action method.

```
class ClientsController < ApplicationController
# This action receives query string parameters from an HTTP GET request
# at the URL "/clients?status=activated"
def index
if params[:status] == "activated"
@clients = Client.activated
else
@clients = Client.inactivated
end
end
```
```
# This action receives parameters from a POST request to "/clients" URL with form data in
the request body.
def create
@client = Client.new(params[:client])
if @client.save
redirect_to @client
else
render "new"
end
end
end
```

### 3.1. Hash and Array Parameters

###### The params hash is not limited to one-dimensional keys and values. It can contain nested arrays and hashes. To

###### send an array of values, append an empty pair of square brackets [] to the key name:

###### The value of params[:ids] will be the array ["1", "2", "3"]. Note that parameter values are always strings;

###### Rails does not attempt to guess or cast the type.

###### To send a hash, you include the key name inside the brackets:

###### When this form is submitted, the value of params[:user] will be { "name" =>

```
"Acme", "phone" => "12345", "address" => { "postcode" => "12345", "city" =>
```
###### "Carrot City" } }. Note the nested hash in params[:user][:address].

###### The params object acts like a Hash, but lets you use symbols and strings interchangeably as keys.

###### The params hash is not a plain old Ruby Hash; instead, it is an ActionController::Parameters

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html) object. It does not

###### inherit from Hash, but it behaves mostly like Hash. It provides methods for filtering params and, unlike

###### a Hash, keys :foo and "foo" are considered to be the same.

```
GET /users?ids[]=1&ids[]=2&ids[]=
```
###### The actual URL in this example will be encoded as /users?ids%5b%5d=1&ids%5b%5d=2&ids%5b%5d=

###### as the [ and ] characters are not allowed in URLs. Most of the time you don't have to worry about this

###### because the browser will encode it for you, and Rails will decode it automatically, but if you ever find

###### yourself having to send those requests to the server manually you should keep this in mind.

###### Values such as [nil] or [nil, nil, ...] in params are replaced with [] for security reasons by

###### default. See Security Guide (security.html#unsafe-query-generation) for more information.

```
<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/users" method="post">
<input type="text" name="user[name]" value="Acme" />
<input type="text" name="user[phone]" value="12345" />
<input type="text" name="user[address][postcode]" value="12345" />
<input type="text" name="user[address][city]" value="Carrot City" />
</form>
```

### 3.2. Composite Key Parameters

###### Composite key parameters (active_record_composite_primary_keys.html) contain multiple values in one

###### parameter separated by a delimiter (e.g., an underscore). Therefore, you will need to extract each value so that you

###### can pass them to Active Record. You can use the extract_value method to do that.

###### For example, given the following controller:

###### And this route:

###### When a user requests the URL /books/4_2, the controller will extract the composite key value ["4", "2"] and

###### pass it to Book.find. The extract_value method may be used to extract arrays out of any delimited parameters.

### 3.3. JSON Parameters

###### If your application exposes an API, you will likely accept parameters in JSON format. If the content-type header

###### of your request is set to application/json, Rails will automatically load your parameters into the params hash,

###### which you can access as you would normally.

###### So for example, if you are sending this JSON content:

###### Your controller will receive:

```
class BooksController < ApplicationController
def show
# Extract the composite ID value from URL parameters.
id = params.extract_value(:id)
@book = Book.find(id)
end
end
```
```
get "/books/:id", to: "books#show"
```
```
{ "user": { "name": "acme", "address": "123 Carrot Street" } }
```
```
{ "user" => { "name" => "acme", "address" => "123 Carrot Street" } }
```

#### 3.3.1. Configuring Wrap Parameters

###### You can use Wrap Parameters

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/ParamsWrapper/Options/ClassMethods.html#method-

###### i-wrap_parameters) , which automatically add the controller name to JSON parameters. For example, you can send

###### the below JSON without a root :user key prefix:

###### Assuming that you're sending the above data to the UsersController, the JSON will be wrapped within the

###### :user key like this:

###### This feature clones and wraps parameters with a key chosen based on your controller's name. It is configured to

###### true by default. If you do not want to wrap parameters you can configure (configuring.html#config-action-

###### controller-wrap-parameters-by-default) it to false.

###### You can also customize the name of the key or specific parameters you want to wrap, see the API documentation

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/ParamsWrapper.html) for more.

### 3.4. Routing Parameters

###### Parameters specified as part of a route declaration in the routes.rb file are also made available in the params

###### hash. For example, we can add a route that captures the :status parameter for a client:

###### When a user navigates to /clients/active URL, params[:status] will be set to "active". When this route is

###### used, params[:foo] will also be set to "bar", as if it were passed in the query string.

```
{ "name": "acme", "address": "123 Carrot Street" }
```
```
{ name: "acme", address: "123 Carrot Street", user: { name: "acme", address: "123 Carrot
Street" } }
```
###### Wrap Parameters adds a clone of the parameters to the hash within a key that is the same as the

###### controller name. As a result, both the original version of the parameters and the "wrapped" version of

###### the parameters will exist in the params hash.

```
config.action_controller.wrap_parameters_by_default = false
```
```
get "/clients/:status", to: "clients#index", foo: "bar"
```

###### Any other parameters defined by the route declaration, such as :id, will also be available.

### 3.5. The default_url_options Method

###### You can set global default parameters for url_for

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionView/RoutingUrlFor.html#method-i-url_for) by defining a

###### method called default_url_options in your controller. For example:

###### The specified defaults will be used as a starting point when generating URLs. They can be overridden by the

###### options passed to url_for or any path helper such as posts_path. For example, by setting locale:

###### I18n.locale, Rails will automatically add the locale to every URL

###### You can still override this default if needed:

###### If you define default_url_options in ApplicationController, as in the example above, these defaults will be

###### used for all URL generation. The method can also be defined in a specific controller, in which case it only applies to

###### URLs generated for that controller.

###### In the above example, your controller will also receive params[:action] as "index" and

###### params[:controller] as "clients". The params hash will always contain the :controller and

###### :action keys, but it's recommended to use the methods controller_name

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Metal.html#method-i-controller_name)

###### and action_name

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/AbstractController/Base.html#method-i-action_name)

###### instead to access these values.

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
def default_url_options
{ locale: I18n.locale }
end
end
```
```
posts_path # => "/posts?locale=en"
```
```
posts_path(locale: :fr) # => "/posts?locale=fr"
```
###### Under the hood, posts_path is a shorthand for calling url_for with the appropriate parameters.

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html 7 / 28


##### Page 8 of 28

###### In a given request, the method is not actually called for every single generated URL. For performance reasons the

###### returned hash is cached per request.

## 4. Strong Parameters

###### With Action Controller Strong Parameters

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/StrongParameters.html) , parameters cannot be

###### used in Active Model mass assignments until they have been explicitly permitted. This means you will need to

###### decide which attributes to permit for mass update and declare them in the controller. This is a security practice to

###### prevent users from accidentally updating sensitive model attributes.

###### In addition, parameters can be marked as required and the request will result in a 400 Bad Request being returned

###### if not all required parameters are passed in.

### 4.1. Permitting Values

#### 4.1.1. expect

###### The expect (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html#method-i-expect)

###### method provides a concise and safe way to require and permit parameters.

```
class PeopleController < ActionController::Base
# This will raise an ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError
# because it's using mass assignment without an explicit permit.
def create
Person.create(params[:person])
end
```
```
# This will work as we are using `person_params` helper method, which has the
# call to `expect` to allow mass assignment.
def update
person = Person.find(params[:id])
person.update!(person_params)
redirect_to person
end
```
```
private
# Using a private method to encapsulate the permitted parameters is a good
# pattern. You can use the same list for both create and update.
def person_params
params.expect(person: [:name, :age])
end
end
```

###### The above expect will always return a scalar value and not an array or hash. Another example is form params, you

###### can use expect to ensure that the root key is present and the attributes are permitted.

###### In the above example, if the :user key is not a nested hash with the specified keys, expect will raise an error and

###### return a 400 Bad Request response.

###### To require and permit an entire hash of parameters, expect

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html#method-i-expect) can be used in

###### this way.

###### This marks the :log_entry parameters hash and any sub-hash of it as permitted and does not check for

###### permitted scalars, anything is accepted.

#### 4.1.2. permit

###### Calling permit (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html#method-i-permit)

###### allows the specified key in params (:id or :admin below) for inclusion in mass assignment (e.g. via create or

###### update):

###### For the permitted key :id, its value also needs to be one of these permitted scalar values: String, Symbol,

###### NilClass, Numeric, TrueClass, FalseClass, Date, Time, DateTime, StringIO, IO,

###### ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile, and Rack::Test::UploadedFile.

```
id = params.expect(:id)
```
```
user_params = params.expect(user: [:username, :password])
user_params.has_key?(:username) # => true
```
```
params.expect(log_entry: {})
```
###### Extreme care should be taken when calling expect with an empty hash, as it will allow all current and

###### future model attributes to be mass-assigned.

```
params = ActionController::Parameters.new(id: 1, admin: "true")
=> #<ActionController::Parameters {"id"=> 1 , "admin"=>"true"} permitted: false>
params.permit(:id)
=> #<ActionController::Parameters {"id"=> 1 } permitted: true>
params.permit(:id, :admin)
=> #<ActionController::Parameters {"id"=> 1 , "admin"=>"true"} permitted: true>
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html 9 / 28


##### Page 10 of 28

###### If you have not called permit on the key, it will be filtered out. Arrays, hashes, or any other objects are not injected

###### by default.

###### To include a value in params that's an array of one of the permitted scalar values, you can map the key to an

###### empty array like this:

###### To include hash values, you can map to an empty hash:

###### The above permit call ensures that values in options are permitted scalars and filters out anything else.

#### 4.1.3. permit!

###### There is also permit! (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html#method-i-

###### permit-21 (with an !) which permits an entire hash of parameters without checking the values.

```
params = ActionController::Parameters.new(tags: ["rails", "parameters"])
=> #<ActionController::Parameters {"tags"=>["rails", "parameters"]} permitted: false>
params.permit(tags: [])
=> #<ActionController::Parameters {"tags"=>["rails", "parameters"]} permitted: true>
```
```
params = ActionController::Parameters.new(options: { darkmode: true })
=> #<ActionController::Parameters {"options"=>{"darkmode"=>true}} permitted: false>
params.permit(options: {})
=> #<ActionController::Parameters {"options"=>#<ActionController::Parameters
{"darkmode"=>true} permitted: true>} permitted: true>
```
###### The permit with an empty hash is convenient since sometimes it is not possible or convenient to

###### declare each valid key of a hash parameter or its internal structure. But note that the above permit

###### with an empty hash opens the door to arbitrary input.

```
params = ActionController::Parameters.new(id: 1, admin: "true")
=> #<ActionController::Parameters {"id"=> 1 , "admin"=>"true"} permitted: false>
params.permit!
=> #<ActionController::Parameters {"id"=> 1 , "admin"=>"true"} permitted: true>
```
###### Extreme care should be taken when using permit!, as it will allow all current and future model

###### attributes to be mass-assigned.


### 4.2. Nested Parameters

###### You can also use expect (or permit) on nested parameters, like:

###### This declaration permits the name, emails, and friends attributes and returns them each. It is expected that

###### emails will be an array of permitted scalar values, and that friends will be an array of resources (note the new

###### double array syntax to explicitly require an array) with specific attributes. These attributes should have a name

###### attribute (any permitted scalar values allowed), a hobbies attribute as an array of permitted scalar values, and a

###### family attribute which is restricted to a hash with only a name key and any permitted scalar value.

### 4.3. Examples

###### Here are some examples of how to use permit for different use cases.

###### Example 1  You may want to use the permitted attributes in your new action. This raises the problem that you can't

###### use require (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html#method-i-require)

###### on the root key because, normally, it does not exist when calling new:

```
# Given the example expected params:
params = ActionController::Parameters.new(
name: "Martin",
emails: ["me@example.com"],
friends: [
{ name: "André", family: { name: "RubyGems" }, hobbies: ["keyboards", "card games"] },
{ name: "Kewe", family: { name: "Baroness" }, hobbies: ["video games"] },
]
)
# the following expect will ensure the params are permitted
name, emails, friends = params.expect(
:name, # permitted scalar
emails: [], # array of permitted scalars
friends: [[ # array of permitted Parameter hashes
:name, # permitted scalar
family: [:name], # family: { name: "permitted scalar" }
hobbies: [] # array of permitted scalars
]]
)
```
```
# using `fetch` you can supply a default and use
# the Strong Parameters API from there.
params.fetch(:blog, {}).permit(:title, :author)
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html 11 / 28


##### Page 12 of 28

###### Example 2  The model class method accepts_nested_attributes_for allows you to update and destroy

###### associated records. This is based on the id and _destroy parameters:

###### Example 3  Hashes with integer keys are treated differently, and you can declare the attributes as if they were

###### direct children. You get these kinds of parameters when you use accepts_nested_attributes_for in

###### combination with a has_many association:

###### Example 4  Imagine a scenario where you have parameters representing a product name, and a hash of arbitrary

###### data associated with that product, and you want to permit the product name attribute and also the whole data hash:

## 5. Cookies

###### The concept of a cookie is not specific to Rails. A cookie (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) (also

###### known as an HTTP cookie or a web cookie) is a small piece of data from the server that is saved in the user's

###### browser. The browser may store cookies, create new cookies, modify existing ones, and send them back to the

###### server with later requests. Cookies persist data across web requests and therefore enable web applications to

###### remember user preferences.

###### Rails provides an easy way to access cookies via the cookies

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Cookies.html#method-i-cookies) method, which

###### works like a hash:

```
# permit :id and :_destroy
params.expect(author: [ :name, books_attributes: [[ :title, :id, :_destroy ]] ])
```
```
# To permit the following data:
# {"book" => {"title" => "Some Book",
# "chapters_attributes" => { "1" => {"title" => "First Chapter"},
# "2" => {"title" => "Second Chapter"}}}}
```
```
params.expect(book: [ :title, chapters_attributes: [[ :title ]] ])
```
```
def product_params
params.expect(product: [ :name, data: {} ])
end
```

###### When passed a scalar value, the cookie will be deleted when the user closes their browser. If you want the cookie

###### to expire at a specific time, pass a hash with the :expires option when setting the cookie. For example, to set a

###### cookie that expires in 1 hour:

###### If you want to create cookies that never expire use the permanent cookie jar. This sets the assigned cookies to

###### have an expiration date 20 years from now.

```
class CommentsController < ApplicationController
def new
# Auto-fill the commenter's name if it has been stored in a cookie
@comment = Comment.new(author: cookies[:commenter_name])
end
```
```
def create
@comment = Comment.new(comment_params)
if @comment.save
if params[:remember_name]
# Save the commenter's name in a cookie.
cookies[:commenter_name] = @comment.author
else
# Delete cookie for the commenter's name, if any.
cookies.delete(:commenter_name)
end
redirect_to @comment.article
else
render action: "new"
end
end
end
```
###### To delete a cookie, you need to use cookies.delete(:key). Setting the key to a nil value does not

###### delete the cookie.

```
cookies[:login] = { value: "XJ-122", expires: 1 .hour }
```
```
cookies.permanent[:locale] = "fr"
```

### 5.1. Encrypted and Signed Cookies

###### Since cookies are stored on the client browser, they can be susceptible to tampering and are not considered

###### secure for storing sensitive data. Rails provides a signed cookie jar and an encrypted cookie jar for storing

###### sensitive data. The signed cookie jar appends a cryptographic signature on the cookie values to protect their

###### integrity. The encrypted cookie jar encrypts the values in addition to signing them, so that they cannot be read by

###### the user.

###### Refer to the API documentation (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Cookies.html) for

###### more details.

###### These special cookie jars use a serializer to serialize the cookie values into strings and deserialize them into Ruby

###### objects when read back. You can specify which serializer to use via

###### config.action_dispatch.cookies_serializer (configuring.html#config-action-dispatch-cookies-

###### serializer). The default serializer for new applications is :json.

###### If you need to store these or more complex objects, you may need to manually convert their values when reading

###### them in subsequent requests.

###### If you use the cookie session store, the above applies to the session and flash hash as well.

## 6. Session

###### While cookies are stored client-side, session data is stored server-side (in memory, a database, or a cache), and

###### the duration is usually temporary and tied to the user's session (e.g. until they close the browser). An example use

###### case for session is storing sensitive data like user authentication.

###### In a Rails application, the session is available in the controller and the view.

```
class CookiesController < ApplicationController
def set_cookie
cookies.signed[:user_id] = current_user.id
cookies.encrypted[:expiration_date] = Date.tomorrow # => Thu, 20 Mar 2024
redirect_to action: "read_cookie"
end
```
```
def read_cookie
cookies.encrypted[:expiration_date] # => "2024-03-20"
end
end
```
###### Be aware that JSON has limited support serializing Ruby objects such as Date, Time, and Symbol.

###### These will be serialized and deserialized into Strings.


### 6.1. Working with the Session

###### You can use the session instance method to access the session in your controllers. Session values are stored as

###### key/value pairs like a hash:

###### To store something in the session, you can assign it to a key similar to adding a value to a hash. After a user is

###### authenticated, its id is saved in the session to be used for subsequent requests:

###### To remove something from the session, delete the key/value pair. Deleting the current_user_id key from the

###### session is a typical way to log the user out:

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
private
# Look up the key `:current_user_id` in the session and use it to
# find the current `User`. This is a common way to handle user login in
# a Rails application; logging in sets the session value and
# logging out removes it.
def current_user
@current_user ||= User.find_by(id: session[:current_user_id]) if
session[:current_user_id]
end
end
```
```
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
def create
if user = User.authenticate_by(email: params[:email], password: params[:password])
# Save the user ID in the session so it can be used in
# subsequent requests
session[:current_user_id] = user.id
redirect_to root_url
end
end
end
```
```
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
def destroy
session.delete(:current_user_id)
# Clear the current user as well.
@current_user = nil
redirect_to root_url, status: :see_other
end
end
```

##### Page 16 of 28

###### It is possible to reset the entire session with reset_session

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Metal.html#method-i-reset_session). It is

###### recommended to use reset_session after logging in to avoid session fixation attacks. Please refer to the Security

###### Guide (https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#session-fixation-countermeasures) for details.

### 6.2. The Flash

###### The flash (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html) provides a way to pass

###### temporary data between controller actions. Anything you place in the flash will be available to the very next action

###### and then cleared. The flash is typically used for setting messages (e.g. notices and alerts) in a controller action

###### before redirecting to an action that displays the message to the user.

###### The flash is accessed via the flash

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash/RequestMethods.html#method-i-flash)

###### method. Similar to the session, the flash values are stored as key/value pairs.

###### For example, in the controller action for logging out a user, the controller can set a flash message which can be

###### displayed to the user on the next request:

###### Displaying a message after a user performs some interactive action in your application is a good practice to give

###### the user feedback that their action was successful (or that there were errors).

###### In addition to :notice, you can also use :alert. These are typically styled (using CSS with different colors to

###### indicate their meaning (e.g. green for notices and orange/red for alerts).

###### You can also assign a flash message directly within the redirect_to method by including it as a parameter to

###### redirect_to:

###### You're not limited to notice and alert. You can set any key in a flash (similar to sessions), by assigning it to the

###### :flash argument. For example, assigning :just_signed_up:

###### Sessions are lazily loaded. If you don't access sessions in your action's code, they will not be loaded.

###### Hence, you will never need to disable sessions - not accessing them will do the job.

```
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
def destroy
session.delete(:current_user_id)
flash[:notice] = "You have successfully logged out."
redirect_to root_url, status: :see_other
end
end
```
```
redirect_to root_url, notice: "You have successfully logged out."
redirect_to root_url, alert: "There was an issue."
```

###### This will allow you to have the below in the view:

###### In the above logout example, the destroy action redirects to the application's root_url, where the message is

###### available to be displayed. However, it's not displayed automatically. It's up to the next action to decide what, if

###### anything, it will do with what the previous action put in the flash.

#### 6.2.1. Displaying flash messages

###### If a previous action has set a flash message, it's a good idea to display that to the user. We can accomplish this

###### consistently by adding the HTML for displaying any flash messages in the application's default layout. Here's an

###### example from app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:

###### The name above indicates the type of flash message, such as notice or alert. This information is normally used

###### to style how the message is displayed to the user.

###### Including the reading and displaying of flash messages in the layout ensures that your application will display these

###### automatically, without each view having to include logic to read the flash.

```
redirect_to root_url, flash: { just_signed_up: true }
```
```
<% if flash[:just_signed_up] %>
<p class="welcome">Welcome to our site!</p>
<% end %>
```
```
<html>
<!-- <head/> -->
<body>
<% flash.each do |name, msg| -%>
<%= content_tag :div, msg, class: name %>
<% end -%>
```
```
<!-- more content -->
<%= yield %>
</body>
</html>
```
###### You can filter by name if you want to limit to displaying only notice and alert in layout. Otherwise,

###### all keys set in the flash will be displayed.

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html 17 / 28


##### Page 18 of 28

#### 6.2.2. flash.keep and flash.now

###### flash.keep (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash/FlashHash.html#method-i-keep)

###### is used to carry over the flash value through to an additional request. This is useful when there are multiple

###### redirects.

###### For example, assume that the index action in the controller below corresponds to the root_url. And you want all

###### requests here to be redirected to UsersController#index. If an action sets the flash and redirects to

###### MainController#index, those flash values will be lost when another redirect happens, unless you use

###### flash.keep to make the values persist for another request.

###### flash.now (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash/FlashHash.html#method-i-now) is

###### used to make the flash values available in the same request. By default, adding values to the flash will make them

###### available to the next request. For example, if the create action fails to save a resource, and you render the new

###### template directly, that's not going to result in a new request, but you may still want to display a message using the

###### flash. To do this, you can use flash.now

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash/FlashHash.html#method-i-now) in the same

###### way you use the normal flash:

```
class MainController < ApplicationController
def index
# Will persist all flash values.
flash.keep
```
```
# You can also use a key to keep only some kind of value.
# flash.keep(:notice)
redirect_to users_url
end
end
```
```
class ClientsController < ApplicationController
def create
@client = Client.new(client_params)
if @client.save
# ...
else
flash.now[:error] = "Could not save client"
render action: "new"
end
end
end
```

### 6.3. Session Stores

###### All sessions have a unique ID that represents the session object; these session IDs are stored in a cookie. The

###### actual session objects use one of the following storage mechanisms:

```
ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore
```
###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Session/CookieStore.html)  Stores everything

###### on the client.

```
ActionDispatch::Session::CacheStore
```
###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Session/CacheStore.html)  Stores the data in

###### the Rails cache.

###### ActionDispatch::Session::ActiveRecordStore (https://github.com/rails/activerecord-session_store)

######  Stores the data in a database using Active Record (requires the activerecord-session_store

###### (https://github.com/rails/activerecord-session_store) gem).

###### A custom store or a store provided by a third party gem.

###### For most session stores, the unique session ID in the cookie is used to look up session data on the server (e.g. a

###### database table). Rails does not allow you to pass the session ID in the URL as this is less secure.

#### 6.3.1. CookieStore

###### The CookieStore is the default and recommended session store. It stores all session data in the cookie itself (the

###### session ID is still available to you if you need it). The CookieStore is lightweight and does not require any

###### configuration to use in a new application.

###### The CookieStore can store 4 kB of data - much less than the other storage options - but this is usually enough.

###### Storing large amounts of data in the session is discouraged. You should especially avoid storing complex objects

###### (such as model instances) in the session.

#### 6.3.2. CacheStore

###### You can use the CacheStore if your sessions don't store critical data or don't need to be around for long periods

###### (for instance if you just use the flash for messaging). This will store sessions using the cache implementation you

###### have configured for your application. The advantage is that you can use your existing cache infrastructure for

###### storing sessions without requiring any additional setup or administration. The downside is that the session storage

###### will be temporary and they could disappear at any time.

###### Read more about session storage in the Security Guide (security.html#sessions).

### 6.4. Session Storage Options

###### There are a few configuration options related to session storage. You can configure the type of storage in an

###### initializer:

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html 19 / 28


##### Page 20 of 28

###### Rails sets up a session key (the name of the cookie) when signing the session data. These can also be changed in

###### an initializer:

###### You can also pass a :domain key and specify the domain name for the cookie:

###### Rails sets up a secret key for CookieStore used for signing the session data in config/credentials.yml.enc.

###### The credentials can be updated with bin/rails

###### credentials:edit.

```
Rails.application.config.session_store :cache_store
```
```
Rails.application.config.session_store :cookie_store, key: "_your_app_session"
```
###### Be sure to restart your server when you modify an initializer file.

```
Rails.application.config.session_store :cookie_store, key: "_your_app_session", domain:
".example.com"
```
###### See config.session_store (configuring.html#config-session-store) in the configuration guide for

###### more information.

```
# aws:
# access_key_id: 123
# secret_access_key: 345
```
```
# Used as the base secret for all MessageVerifiers in Rails, including the one protecting
cookies.
secret_key_base: 492f...
```
###### Changing the secret_key_base when using the CookieStore will invalidate all existing sessions.

###### You'll need to configure a cookie rotator

###### (https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-dispatch-cookies-rotations) to

###### rotate existing sessions.


## 7. Controller Callbacks

###### Controller callbacks are methods that are defined to automatically run before and/or after a controller action. A

###### controller callback method can be defined in a given controller or in the ApplicationController. Since all

###### controllers inherit from ApplicationController, callbacks defined here will run on every controller in your

###### application.

### 7.1. before_action

###### Callback methods registered via before_action

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/AbstractController/Callbacks/ClassMethods.html#method-i-

###### before_action) run before a controller action. They may halt the request cycle. A common use case for

###### before_action is ensuring that a user is logged in:

###### The method stores an error message in the flash and redirects to the login form if the user is not already logged in.

###### When a before_action callback renders or redirects (like in the example above), the original controller action is

###### not run. If there are additional callbacks registered to run, they are also cancelled and not run.

###### In this example, the before_action is defined in ApplicationController so all controllers in the application

###### inherit it. That implies that all requests in the application will require the user to be logged in. This is fine except for

###### the "login" page. The "login" action should succeed even when the user is not logged in (to allow the user to log in)

###### otherwise the user will never be able to log in. You can use skip_before_action

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/AbstractController/Callbacks/ClassMethods.html#method-i-

###### skip_before_action) to allow specified controller actions to skip a given before_action:

###### Now, the LoginsController's new and create actions will work without requiring the user to be logged in.

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
before_action :require_login
```
```
private
def require_login
unless logged_in?
flash[:error] = "You must be logged in to access this section"
redirect_to new_login_url # halts request cycle
end
end
end
```
```
class LoginsController < ApplicationController
skip_before_action :require_login, only: [:new, :create]
end
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html 21 / 28


##### Page 22 of 28

###### The :only option skips the callback only for the listed actions; there is also an :except option which works the

###### other way. These options can be used when registering action callbacks too, to add callbacks which only run for

###### selected actions.

### 7.2. after_action and around_action

###### You can also define action callbacks to run after a controller action has been executed with after_action

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/AbstractController/Callbacks/ClassMethods.html#method-i-

###### after_action) , or to run both before and after with around_action

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/AbstractController/Callbacks/ClassMethods.html#method-i-

###### around_action).

###### The after_action callbacks are similar to before_action callbacks, but because the controller action has

###### already been run they have access to the response data that's about to be sent to the client.

###### The around_action callbacks are useful when you want to execute code before and after a controller action,

###### allowing you to encapsulate functionality that affects the action's execution. They are responsible for running their

###### associated actions by yielding.

###### For example, imagine you want to monitor the performance of specific actions. You could use an around_action

###### to measure how long each action takes to complete and log this information:

###### If you register the same action callback multiple times with different options, the last action callback

###### definition will overwrite the previous ones.

###### after_action callbacks are executed only after a successful controller action, and not if an exception

###### is raised in the request cycle.

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
around_action :measure_execution_time
```
```
private
def measure_execution_time
start_time = Time.now
yield # This executes the action
end_time = Time.now
```
```
duration = end_time - start_time
Rails.logger.info "Action #{action_name} from controller #{controller_name} took #
{duration.round( 2 )} seconds to execute."
end
end
```

###### The around_action callback also wraps rendering. In the example above, view rendering will be included in the

###### duration. The code after the yield in an around_action is run even when there is an exception in the

###### associated action and there is an ensure block in the callback. This is different from after_action callbacks

###### where an exception in the action cancels the after_action code.)

### 7.3. Other Ways to Use Callbacks

###### In addition to before_action, after_action, or around_action, there are two less common ways to register

###### callbacks.

###### The first is to use a block directly with the *_action methods. The block receives the controller as an argument.

###### For example, the require_login action callback from above could be rewritten to use a block:

###### Note that the action callback, in this case, uses send because the logged_in? method is private, and the action

###### callback does not run in the scope of the controller. This is not the recommended way to implement this particular

###### action callback, but in simpler cases, it might be useful.

###### Specifically for around_action, the block also yields in the action:

###### The second way is to specify a class (or any object that responds to the expected methods) for the callback action.

###### This can be useful in cases that are more complex. As an example, you could rewrite the around_action callback

###### to measure execution time with a class:

###### Action callbacks receive controller_name and action_name as parameters you can use, as shown in

###### the example above.

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
before_action do |controller|
unless controller.send(:logged_in?)
flash[:error] = "You must be logged in to access this section"
redirect_to new_login_url
end
end
end
```
```
around_action { |_controller, action| time(&action) }
```
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html 23 / 28


##### Page 24 of 28

###### In the above example, the ActionDurationCallback's method is not run in the scope of the controller but gets

###### controller as an argument.

###### In general, the class being used for a *_action callback must implement a method with the same name as the

###### action callback. So for the before_action callback, the class must implement a before method, and so on. Also,

###### the around method must yield to execute the action.

## 8. The Request and Response Objects

###### Every controller has two methods, request

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Base.html#method-i-request) and response

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Base.html#method-i-response) , which can be used

###### to access the request and response objects associated with the current request cycle. The request method

###### returns an instance of ActionDispatch::Request

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Request.html). The response

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionController/Base.html#method-i-response) method returns an

###### instance of ActionDispatch::Response

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Response.html) , an object representing what is going

###### to be sent back to the client browser (e.g. from render or redirect in the controller action).

### 8.1. The request Object

###### The request object contains useful information about the request coming in from the client. This section describes

###### the purpose of some of the properties of the request object.

###### To get a full list of the available methods, refer to the Rails API documentation

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Request.html) and Rack

###### (https://rack.github.io/rack/main/Rack/Request.html) documentation.

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
around_action ActionDurationCallback
end
```
```
class ActionDurationCallback
def self.around(controller)
start_time = Time.now
yield # This executes the action
end_time = Time.now
```
```
duration = end_time - start_time
Rails.logger.info "Action #{controller.action_name} from controller #
{controller.controller_name} took #{duration.round( 2 )} seconds to execute."
end
end
```

```
Property of request Purpose
```
###### host The hostname used for this request

###### headers Returns a hash containing the headers associated with the request

###### port The port number i nteger u sed for the request

###### query_string The query string part of the URL i e  e verything after "?"

###### remote_ip The IP address of the client

###### url The entire URL used for the request

#### 8.1.1. query_parameters , request_parameters , and path_parameters

###### Rails collects all of the parameters for a given request in the params hash, including the ones set in the URL as

###### query string parameters, and those sent as the body of a POST request. The request object has three methods that

###### give you access to the various parameters.

###### query_parameters (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Request.html#method-i-

###### query_parameters) - contains parameters that were sent as part of the query string.

###### request_parameters (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Request.html#method-

###### i-request_parameters) - contains parameters sent as part of the post body.

```
path_parameters
```
###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Http/Parameters.html#method-i-

###### path_parameters) - contains parameters parsed by the router as being part of the path leading to this

###### particular controller and action.

#### 8.1.2. request.variant

###### Controllers might need to tailor a response based on context-specific information in a request. For example,

###### controllers responding to requests from a mobile platform might need to render different content than requests

###### from a desktop browser. One strategy to accomplish this is by customizing a request's variant. Variant names are

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html 25 / 28


##### Page 26 of 28

###### arbitrary, and can communicate anything from the request's platform (:android, :ios, :linux, :macos,

###### :windows) to its browser (:chrome, :edge, :firefox, :safari), to the type of user (:admin, :guest,

###### :user).

###### You can set the request.variant

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Http/MimeNegotiation.html#method-i-variant-3D

###### in a before_action:

###### Responding with a variant in a controller action is like responding with a format:

###### A separate template should be created for each format and variant:

```
app/views/projects/show.html.erb
app/views/projects/show.html+tablet.erb
app/views/projects/show.html+phone.erb
```
###### You can also simplify the variants definition using the inline syntax:

### 8.2. The response Object

###### The response object is built up during the execution of the action from rendering data to be sent back to the client

###### browser. It's not usually used directly but sometimes, in an after_action callback for example, it can be useful to

###### access the response directly. One use case is for setting the content type header:

```
request.variant = :tablet if request.user_agent.include?("iPad")
```
```
# app/controllers/projects_controller.rb
```
```
def show
# ...
respond_to do |format|
format.html do |html|
html.tablet # renders app/views/projects/show.html+tablet.erb
html.phone { extra_setup; render } # renders app/views/projects/show.html+phone.erb
end
end
end
```
```
respond_to do |format|
format.html.tablet
format.html.phone { extra_setup; render }
end
```

###### Another use case is for setting custom response headers:

###### The headers attribute is a hash which maps header names to header values. Rails sets some headers

###### automatically but if you need to update a header or add a custom header, you can use response.headers as in

###### the example above.

###### Here are some of the properties of the response object:

```
Property of
response Purpose
```
###### body This is the string of data being sent back to the client T his is most often HTML

```
status
```
###### The HTTP status code for the response l ike   for a successful request or   for file not

###### found

###### location The URL the client is being redirected to if any

###### content_type The content type of the response

###### charset The character set being used for the response D efault is "utf"

###### headers Headers used for the response

###### To get a full list of the available methods, refer to the Rails API documentation

###### (https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActionDispatch/Response.html) and Rack Documentation

###### (https://rack.github.io/rack/main/Rack/Response.html).

## Feedback

###### You're encouraged to help improve the quality of this guide.

```
response.content_type = "application/pdf"
```
```
response.headers["X-Custom-Header"] = "some value"
```
###### The headers method can be accessed directly in the controller as well.
